# 📡 professorNAV – The GNSS Code & Theory Tutor

**professorNAV** is a RAG-powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI tutor and coding assistant for **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)**. Whether you’re working with GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, or IRNSS, professorNAV provides instant explanations of GNSS concepts and generates reliable, optimized code in **Python, C, C++**, and **Rust** for building positioning software, SDRs, and integrated navigation systems.

## 🌍 GNSS Constellations Supported

professorNAV is built with a **global scope**, supporting:

| Constellation    | Region / Origin       | Signal Formats             |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **GPS**          | USA                    | L1 C/A, L2C, L5             |
| **GLONASS**      | Russia                 | L1OF, L2OF, CDMA            |
| **Galileo**      | Europe (EU)            | E1, E5a, E5b, E6            |
| **BeiDou**       | China                  | B1I, B1C, B2a, B2b          |
| **QZSS**         | Japan (regional)       | L1C/A, L1S, L2C, L5, L6     |
| **IRNSS (NavIC)**| India (regional)       | L5, S-band                  |

professorNAV is capable of answering questions, generating code in various programming languges including C, C++, Python, Rust, and Go across **multi-constellation** and **multi-frequency** environments.

## 📚 Embedded GNSS Literature

professorNAV uses a **vector database** populated with curated content from the most authoritative GNSS books and specifications:

1. **Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance** – *Misra & Enge*
2. **Understanding GPS/GNSS: Principles and Applications** – *Kaplan & Hegarty*
3. **Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems** – *Paul Groves*
4. **GNSS, Inertial Navigation, and Integration** – *Grewal, Weill & Andrews*
5. **Galileo Open Service SIS ICD** – *European GNSS Agency (GSA)*
6. **GLONASS Interface Control Document**
7. **BeiDou Signal in Space ICD**
8. **QZSS Interface Specifications (IS-QZSS)**
9. **IRNSS ICD** – *ISRO*

🧠 The vector DB is used in combination with a language model to deliver **contextual, source-grounded answers** to GNSS queries.
