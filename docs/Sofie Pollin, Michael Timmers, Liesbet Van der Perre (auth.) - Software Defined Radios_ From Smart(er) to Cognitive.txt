Preface
The perfect engine does not win the race. Similarly, Software Deﬁned Radio and
Opportunistic Spectrum Access open up great opportunities to realize ubiquitous
wireless services. However, only smart(er) operation of these engines will result in
truly beneﬁting from them. In this book we aim to introduce and apply a practi-
cal design approach towards smart(er) and cognitive radios. We are grateful that
Springer is willing to publish this book on smart(er) and cognitive radios, whereby
we don’t want to claim other radios (books) were dumb. Dear reader, we hope you
may ﬁnd some ideas of interest to your work or study, or maybe a case that could
help improve your products. We want to acknowledge our colleagues at IMEC, Bell
Labs and their networks for their great scientiﬁc contribution, and the enlighten-
ing discussions, both technically and way beyond. This book’s creation faced ﬁerce
competition from our busy professional occupation, and ‘rush-hour’ in our personal
life. Two babies left the ‘design phase’ to go in ‘real-life operation’, and even run-
time, while three other children showed to be running ever faster, and evolving to
‘advanced cognitive’ behavior. We thank Liselore, Seppe, Stien, Nore and Sara for
the inspiration they bring in our lives.

Standards continue to accommodate higher mobility and achieve

standards, can be seen today

In the upper part, the current Belgian spectrum plan is shown
[13]. Spectrum appears to be very scarce as no bands are
apparently left free to allocate. However, the lower part shows
measurements of the same frequency range taken by the IMEC
Scaldio chip on at 13h15, 6th of July 2009. When we take a
snapshot at a certain time and location, a lot of this licensed
spectrum is not being used. Indeed, only the popular standards
seem to be semi-densely used. However, measurements by TU
Berlin have shown that even for the extremely popular GSM
standard OSA remains viable [14] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A condensed version of the proposed framework. DT procedures
that are established from DT models observe the RT situations
and map this to a scenario. The DT procedure linked with the
observed scenario is calibrated at RT by the RT learning engine . .
45
Fig. 3.2
The proposed framework separates DT and RT. While the DT
part is a feed-forward process, the RT is a feedback process. This
feedback process is essential for CR systems to calibrate and
learn procedures at RT

Fig. 4.1
Spatial reuse in wireless networks requires high sensitivity
receivers and moreover never achieves optimal adaptation to the
real propagation conditions, since safety margins are needed
to avoid interference to the potential receivers with unknown
channels. We want to achieve optimal spatial reuse (i.e., without
safety margins that limit the gain), while relaxing the receiver
sensitivity constraints . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Focus of this chapter is on the monitoring challenge for
cognitive radio. The actions are setting the power of the
Opportunistic Radio, and these actions are a direct consequence
of the monitored environment and a model that translates this
environment to a power setting. This model was determined at
design time and is not learned by the Opportunistic Radio . . . . .

chapter. The two right images show measurement points and
denoised RSSI signals with 95% conﬁdence intervals for two
different slices. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the
RSSI contour threshold on the left image. Note the high noise
levels, the absence of a clear trend and the very different results
along the two directions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Black nodes (such as f1 and f2) correspond to interior nodes
(i.e., nodes inside the contour). The straight lines trace the
regions which are closest to a certain interior node (i.e., the
Voronoi regions). The new proposed backoff scheme ensures
that nodes (such as A and B) which are closer to the interior
contour nodes are updated ﬁrst before they propagate this contour
distance information to the other nodes. This propagation can be
performed at a cost of almost N transmissions, the total number
of nodes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Iterative power adjustment for 3 simulation scenarios of 1 km2
with communication range h = 95 m, quadratic MLS and σN = 4
which is the variance noticed on the outdoor measurements. Each
box represents a building causing shadowing losses. The solid
curves represent the approximation of the primary signal’s and
the secondary transmitter’s interference contour. The dotted lines
are the real (noise-free) contours. The straight line on each image
corresponds to the contour-to-contour distance as computed by
our algorithm. Row A shows for each example the resulting
contour for the initial suboptimal power. Note the small area
covered by the initial secondary contour. From the estimated
local pathloss model at the secondary transmitter’s contour point,
a new transmission power is computed. Rows B and C show the
result of this iterative process. Note the large difference between
the secondary transmitter’s coverage area at the original estimate
in A and the resulting contour in C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 both operate in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. This leads to coexistence issues, most prominently at
the side of the ZigBee network . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Fig. 5.2
The considered scenario is a string topology of IEEE 802.15.4
terminals, where terminals report to a sink that is placed at one
side of the string. Interference is generated by WLAN devices
and is dynamic in both time and space . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
75
Fig. 5.3
The framework of the dynamic frequency selection algorithms
relies on feedback from the environment. The performance
increase of the learning engine allows to decrease the quality
of the feedback (no out-of-band scanning), while maintaining
similar performance (see Sect. 5.7) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Fig. 5.4
Local optima cause very large delays. Cooling down in a local
optimum causes a disjunction between two sets of terminals that
have converged on different channels. Any packet generated on
the left-hand side will never reach the sink . . . . . . . . . . . . .

These are instantaneous delays for different size networks. All
16 ZigBee channels are assumed to be available. Simulation
procedure is the following: we allow the algorithms to reach a
certain point. At that point, a packet is generated in the network.
The instantaneous delay is then the delay of this packet. In these
ﬁgures, the delays are averaged over 400 packets per run and 100
runs are executed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Multi-agent q-learning using simulated annealing is not
guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium. In this example,
the Nash equilibrium is (L, D). However, during initial
exploration, when all the actions are equiprobable, player 2 may
decide that U is the better choice as it has an average proﬁt of 8
and D only yields a proﬁt of 5. As it is unaware of the actions
taken by player 1, player 2 fails to notice that player 1 settles
on L. Hence, player 2 goes for the safe option where it cannot be

Serving Many Mobile Users in Various
Scenarios: Radios to Go Smart(er)
and Cognitive
1.1 Towards Cognitive Radio
Anything, anytime, anywhere! The holy grail of wireless communication is coming
closer. However, signiﬁcant hurdles still need to be taken. Indeed, Anytime would
require the systems to have an inﬁnite amount of energy resources, so as to guar-
antee an endless operation. Further, Anything implicitly means that the Quality of
Service (QoS) guarantees are as tough as they are diverse. Finally, Anywhere would
require the systems to be able to operate effectively in a broad range of heteroge-
neous environments.
The main difﬁculty behind the AAA paradigm lies in the scarcity of the used
resources. Thus, it is critical to share this resource efﬁciently and effectively. In
this book, we focus on wireless spectrum and energy as scarce resources and which
are, hence, becoming expensive. Moreover, the increased ﬂexibility in radio hard-
ware and wireless standards is both opening new opportunities and posing new chal-
lenges. As a result, radios need to evolve to smart and cognitive.
In this introductory chapter, we embark by highlighting how HardWare (HW)
implementation and policy guidelines are becoming increasingly ﬂexible. We then
present the Cognitive Radio (CR) framework that implements the necessary control
functionality to harness this ﬂexibility. The need for smart and cognitive radios is
explained, and the way forward as proposed in this book is introduced.
1.2 Increasing the Hardware Flexibility
The current and emerging wireless telecommunication landscape is pushing for
more hardware ﬂexibility. Software Deﬁned Radios (SDRs) give an answer to this
need.

Serving Many Mobile Users in Various Scenarios
Fig. 1.1 Standards continue to accommodate higher mobility and achieve higher throughput. To
accommodate the wishes of the wireless user, a divergence, rather than a convergence, of wireless
standards, can be seen today
1.2.1 Wireless Landscape Giving Challenges and Opportunities
Wireless standards continue to diverge, driven by heterogeneous user and applica-
tion requirements. Increased ﬂexibility in radios may offer the long desired seamless
connectivity. This increased ﬂexibility is not only a functional wish, due to the in-
creasing cost of ASIC designs it also becomes an economic necessity [1].
1.2.1.1 Heterogeneity Desires Flexibility
Wireless communications are routinely used today for a large variety of applica-
tions, including voice, data transfer, Internet access, audio and video streaming and
social networking. For one speciﬁc service, several systems have been standardized
and some have become the preferred option in several regions of the world.
Pushed by the insatiable demand for bandwidth and pulled by the steady im-
provement of semiconductor technology, the performance delivered by wireless
standards is destined to improve, seemingly without bounds (see Fig. 1.1). To ac-
commodate the diverse wishes of the wireless user, we are witnessing a divergence,
rather than convergence, of wireless standards. This is especially true in terms of
various modes of use.
From a user perspective, it is, hence, attractive to have a single handheld device
that can support a large variety of wireless standards. This ensures interoperabil-
ity and gives the user access to a wide variety of applications. As a result, mobile

1.2

handsets have started supporting multiple modes over the past years. Initially, this
has been achieved by integrating multiple radios into one handset. However, when
the number of radios increases, the cost, size, and weight of the terminal are also
affected. Hence, a single radio that comprises all necessary functionality is highly
sought-after [1, 2]. Users want to enjoy a multitude of services on one terminal. Pre-
dictions claim that handheld devices need to support at least six different radios at
the short term. Hence, also from a functionality point of view, ﬂexibility is becoming
essential.
1.2.1.2 Enabling Seamless Connectivity
Ubiquitous and seamless connectivity can be achieved in a heterogeneous network
environment, under the condition that both terminals and network feature the neces-
sary reconﬁguration capabilities to support horizontal (between access points of one
technology) and vertical (between access points supporting different technologies)
roaming. Recently, the need for such reconﬁguration support is receiving attention
in speciﬁc standardization initiatives (see Chap. 2).
1.2.1.3 Scaling Technology Imposes Reconﬁgurability
Gordon E. Moore predicted 45 years ago, that the number of transistors on a chip
would double about every 2 years. So far, history has proved him correct [3]. Scal-
ing has brought enormous processing capabilities packed on small areas, opening
opportunities to implement ﬂexible platforms at low cost and low power.
However, for newer technologies, the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs
related to System-on-Chip (SoC) design are rising exponentially. On top of this,
design cost has increased dramatically and is expected to continue to do so. Not only
is the design complexity increasing, CMOS scaling has arrived at the point where
parasitic problems are becoming dominant. As these effects cannot be resolved at
the transistor side, new designs will need to take these problems into account.
The question whether scaling is still viable is sounding louder each day, espe-
cially for custom ASIC chips. While higher production volumes can still compen-
sate the NRE costs, cost trade-offs show, already today, an advantage in using re-
conﬁgurable radios to single-mode devices for smaller markets. For these instances,
the extra area penalty is not signiﬁcant compared to the cost cutting in NRE.
The extra area penalty can be furthermore easily compensated for multi-mode
terminals. In those terminals the possibility exists to reuse silicon and thus signif-
icantly reduce overall area, which makes ﬂexible platforms even more attractive.
Also other cost factors, like assembly cost, form factor and time-to-market, direct
towards chip reuse and, hence, the HW platform paradigm [4, 5].

1.2.2 The Software-Deﬁned Radio Solution
As mentioned above, only ﬂexible radios enable the AAA paradigm, as their ﬂexi-
bility allows them to operate in any environment and under any user request. This
observation gave birth to the concept of Software Radio (SR), an extremely ﬂexible
radio. Today, the SR-concept is well established, but the ultimate SR (uSR) is still
not in reach. According to the SDRForum such an uSR accepts fully programmable
trafﬁc and control information, supports operation over a broad range of frequen-
cies and can switch from one air-interface to another in milliseconds [6]. Though
the uSR might not yet be in reach, the research community has already made signif-
icant advances to increase the hardware ﬂexibility.
In Table 1.1, the initial 5-tier concept of the SDRForum is presented [7]. The
early radios were baseline radios with ﬁxed functionality, called Hardware Radios
(HRs). Today, it may be argued that virtually all modern wireless communications
equipment can be classiﬁed as Software Controlled Radios. These radios implement
the signal path using application-speciﬁc hardware, i.e., the signal path is essentially
ﬁxed. A software interface may allow certain parameters to be changed in software.
For most applications, the state-of-the-art ﬂexible radios are Software Deﬁned Ra-
dios (SDRs) (i.e. Tier 2). These radios allow the signal path to be reconﬁgured in
software without requiring any hardware modiﬁcations. As the uSR is considered
to be the blue-sky vision of SDR, the next target is the ideal Software Radio (iSR).
Compared to a standard SDR, an iSR implements much more of the signal path in
the digital domain. Ultimately, programmability would extend to the entire system
with Analog/Digital Conversion (ADC) taking place at the antenna.
1.3 Increasing the Policy Flexibility
Regulatory bodies are being pushed to deﬁne spectrum access policies more ﬂex-
ible. The Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) concept, the ultimate goal of ﬂexible
spectrum access, ideally could realize the optimal usage of the spectrum.

1.3.1 Spectrum: A Scarce Resource
Like water, air or oil, the wireless spectrum is a shared resource. This, however, does
not imply that it should be free! Wireless spectrum needs to be shared with many
applications, and, hence, it has become expensive. To deliver the required expensive
service, regulatory bodies are using a ﬁxed frequency allocation scheme, out of fear
of harmful interference, which jeopardizes the quality of the delivered service. They
allocate spectrum blocks for multiple years and over large areas. The only exception
to this allocation scheme, is the ISM band, where heterogeneous devices can coexist
using high-level Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) etiquettes.
Due to this ﬁxed frequency allocation scheme, along with the accelerated de-
ployment of broadband communication systems, spectrum is, hence, becoming a
major bottleneck. New applications require more and more spectrum, but no useful
spectrum is apparently left to be allocated (see upper part of Fig. 1.2).
However, experiments show that up to 85% of the spectrum remains unused at
a given time and location, indicating that a more ﬂexible allocation strategy could
solve the spectrum scarcity problem [8]. We have conﬁrmed this through measure-
ments using the IMEC Scaldio [9] (see bottom part of Fig. 1.2).
This inefﬁcient use of spectrum and the success of the ISM bands has coerced
regulatory bodies into deﬁning a roadmap towards more local, organic and dynamic
spectrum sharing policies [10–12].
1.3.2 The Opportunistic Spectrum Access Solution
As mentioned above, a need for policies to share spectrum dynamically exists.
A prime example of such a ﬂexible policy is Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA),
where users can actively search for unused spectrum in licensed bands and commu-
nicate using these white holes. OSA is supported by regulatory bodies, such as the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [10] and the European Commission
(EC) [12]. The concept is also often ambiguously referred to as Cognitive Radio
(CR). We discuss the ambiguity of this terminology in Sect. 1.4.
The ultimate goal of the roadmap for more local and organic spectrum policies,
is called Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). In DSA networks licenses and priori-
ties are not ﬁxed at Design Time (DT). DSA networks should allow terminals and
technologies to negotiate the use of wireless spectrum locally for a time window of
hours, minutes or even seconds. Like the SR, which presents the ultimate ﬂexible
radio, DSA is not yet in sight. However, OSA is a ﬁrst disruptive step towards this
ultimate goal.

Fig. 1.2 In the upper part, the current Belgian spectrum plan is shown [13]. Spectrum appears to be very scarce as no bands are apparently left free to allocate.
However, the lower part shows measurements of the same frequency range taken by the IMEC Scaldio chip on at 13h15, 6th of July 2009. When we take a
snapshot at a certain time and location, a lot of this licensed spectrum is not being used. Indeed, only the popular standards seem to be semi-densely used.
However, measurements by TU Berlin have shown that even for the extremely popular GSM standard OSA remains viable [14]

Cognitive Radio: Exploiting Flexibility with Intelligent Control

Fig. 1.3 A comparison between the cognition cycles of Mitola and Haykin
1.4 Cognitive Radio: Exploiting Flexibility with Intelligent
Control
The Cognitive Radio (CR) concept brings an answer to exploit the increased ﬂexi-
bility with smart(er) control solutions.
The CR was ﬁrst described by Mitola in [15, 16] as a decision making layer
in which “wireless personal digital assistants and the related networks were sufﬁ-
ciently computationally intelligent about radio resources, and related computer-to-
computer communications, to detect user needs as a function of use context, and
to provide radio resources and wireless services most appropriate to those needs”.
Through the eyes of Mitola CR was a natural extension of the SDR. His CR cycle
can be seen in Fig. 1.3(a).
Six years after Mitola’s ﬁrst CR article, Simon Haykin recapitulated the CR
idea as an enabler of brain-empowered communication [17]. He identiﬁed six key
parts of CR: awareness, intelligence, learning, adaptivity, reliability and efﬁciency.
Thus, his deﬁnition broadly complies with Mitola’s viewpoint. In his seminal paper,
Haykin instantiated CR for OSA as can be seen in Fig. 1.3(b). In this simpliﬁed
cognition cycle only 2 key elements of his CR are instantiated: environment aware-
ness (radio-scene analysis and channel estimation) and adaptivity (transmit power
control and dynamic spectrum management).
Together with the initial focus of CR research on enabling environmental aware-
ness through spectrum sensing, this led to people using CR as an equivalent of OR.

Serving Many Mobile Users in Various Scenarios
Fig. 1.4 The Cognitive Radio is an adaptive feedback-based layer to control the increasing ﬂexi-
bility, of which prime examples are the SDR (at the hardware side) and OR (at the spectrum side)
For instance, IEEE 802.22 was marketed as the ﬁrst CR standard, while it actu-
ally carries few of the key elements present of the CR as deﬁned by Mitola or
Haykin.
Mitola and Haykin actually saw the CR as an answer to the following questions:
• “What can we do with the increasing HW ﬂexibility provided by the SDR?” (Mi-
tola, 1999).
• “What can we do with the increasing policy ﬂexibility provided by regulators?”
(Haykin, 2004).
The common denominator of these two visions is to deﬁne a CR as an intelligent
control framework to handle the increased ﬂexibility.
To avoid ambiguity, throughout this book, the spectrum-oriented view on CR
(OSA) is denoted as Opportunistic Radio (OR). CR denotes an adaptive feedback-
based layer to control the increasing ﬂexibility, of which prime examples are the
SDR (at the hardware side) and OR (at the spectrum side). This can be seen in
Fig. 1.4. An adaptive radio that exploits ﬂexibility to improve on QoS or energy cost,
but does not learn the optimal conﬁguration based on feedback, will be denoted as
a smart radio.

The Need for a New Approach

1.5 The Need for a New Approach
This book proposes a framework that is able to exploit the ﬂexibility offered by
the disruptive radio hardware and spectrum access paradigms. The main problem
considered is the sharing of wireless spectrum. To intelligently share this spectrum,
terminals need to interact with their actual environment to learn its behavior and
adapt accordingly. As mentioned in Sect. 1.4, a CR system heavily relies on the
existence of a feedback channel from the environment. Hence, the proposed frame-
work is fully compatible with the CR paradigm. In the Mitola vision it is theo-
retically proposed to learn everything in real time. For practical applications, we
introduce a framework that is able to extract useful information upfront, when de-
signing the system. Consequently, the performance in operation can be improved
greatly. In [18, 19] it is demonstrated that a hybrid Design Time (DT)–Run Time
(RT) framework allows for very efﬁcient operations. In such DT-RT framework,
procedures are developed at DT. At RT, these procedures can be efﬁciently executed
by monitoring the environment and selecting the appropriate procedure. However,
due to the increasing ﬂexibility of wireless terminals, it is becoming harder to predict
all possible situations. Furthermore, due to the increasing environment dynamics, it
is also becoming harder to model these situations. Our framework should hence be
ﬂexible enough to allow calibration and learning.
We propose an extended DT-RT framework and maintain its efﬁcient operation.
In line with the CR paradigm, the framework is made ﬂexible enough so the terminal
can change its behavior based on interaction with the environment. Feedback-based
learning is enabled in the framework, fully in line with the CR deﬁnitions introduced
earlier.
1.6 Radios to Go Smarter and Cognitive
In this book, we aim to introduce how Software Deﬁned Radios can be conceived
to become smart(er) and cognitive. Indeed the opportunities brought about by the
improved ﬂexibility and degrees of freedom, bring along an increased control com-
plexity. Exploiting this complexity is a challenge, which holds the opportunity to
use scarce resources spectrum and energy in an optimal way. The optimization itself
should work in practical cases and come at minimal overhead.We thereto sketch the
standardization scene, introduce methodological concepts, and discuss the applica-
tion to relevant case studies:
• Chapter 2 discusses some of the major wireless standards to illustrate how in-
creased ﬂexibility and control is becoming abundant, even within a single wireless
technology. Next to ﬂexibility within standards, focus is on coexistence between
standards and ﬁnally cooperation across standards. The latter often requires a
ﬂexibility across standards and increased intelligence. This drives the need for
SDR and ﬁnally CR.

10
1
Serving Many Mobile Users in Various Scenarios
• Chapter 3 introduces a general control strategy that is able to adapt ﬂexibly to
the environment without heavily impacting the run-time complexity. The method
proposed consists of a preparation (‘design time’) and an operation phase (‘run
time process’). The degree of intelligence and adaptation enabled in the run time
process typically determines how smart the radio is. It will be shown that the run
time involves four main tasks: monitoring or observing, determining the current
scenario, acting on the scenario following a procedure and ﬁnally learning or cal-
ibrating the procedure. In the subsequent chapters, case studies will be presented
that involve each of the four tasks, but however, emphasis will be on one of the
tasks.
• Chapter 4 discusses a scenario where licensed users share their resources with
opportunistic radios. In this case, the OR needs to sufﬁciently monitor the actual
situation to avoid interference to the licensed technology. In Chap. 4 the ﬂow will
hence be applied to a OR scenario with special focus on the monitoring.
• Chapter 5 discusses a coexistence situation. Speciﬁcally, it considers the scenario
where an IEEE 802.15.4 networks coexists with an IEEE 802.11 network in the
ISM band by adapting its channel. In this case, monitoring is shown not to be
sufﬁcient and determining the actual situation is based on both monitoring and
learning based on feedback from the environment. It is shown how nevertheless,
is possible to instantiate the ﬂow to design a radio that is capable to adapt based
on an identiﬁcation of the actual scenario.
• Chapter 6 gives an example of how the ﬂow can be instantiated on a well-
deﬁned procedure that does not necessary involve a CR or OR. The context will
be an IEEE 802.11 network in which multiple users coexist and have to share
the medium, while meeting performance constraints and minimizing energy cost.
Even for such an IEEE 802.11 network, a ﬂexible radio within a network of ﬂex-
ible radios can be managed smartly to improve the overall QoS or energy efﬁ-
ciency of the network.
• Chapter 7 then gives an example of the most important task of a cognitive radio:
learning and calibrating how it behaves in the environment. How to achieve this
efﬁciently is illustrated in the context of IEEE 802.11 networks that aim at min-
imizing the co-channel interference in a distributed way by adapting the output
power, sensing threshold and transmission parameters.
• Chapter 8 ﬁnally closes the book with major conclusions and a glance at the
future.

Chapter 2
Emerging Standards for Smart Radios:
Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
2.1 Standards in Evolution
In this chapter we detail the standardization roadmap towards an increase in hard-
ware and policy ﬂexibility, described in Chap. 1. This is shown in Fig. 2.1.
First, we discuss the increase in hardware ﬂexibility. While standards typically
do not discuss implementation-related aspects, we describe how parameters have
become more and more dynamic. This trend is clearly driven by the innovation in
the SDR, which is a reconﬁgurable platform solution that supports a range of air
interfaces. Without ﬂexible implementation methodologies, this level of ﬂexibility
could not have been introduced by standardization bodies. As shown in Table 2.1,
we discuss standards for both cellular and distributed technologies.
Afterwards, we discuss the increase in policy or spectrum access ﬂexibility. As
shown in Chap. 1, the ISM bands, where unlicensed devices coexist using only high-
level spectrum etiquettes, have been a clear driver towards more dynamic spectrum
access. In this chapter, we discuss two ways to counter the QoS problem with dy-
namic spectrum access. First, we discuss how the spectrum access is taken a step
back, by introducing more control mechanisms between the different standards in
the ISM bands. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the IEEE 802.11h standard, where algo-
rithms are developed to avoid interference from unlicensed ISM bands towards
satellite and radar systems and the IEEE 802.19 standard, which takes care of cross-
technology coexistence. The second way to counter the QoS problem of dynamic
spectrum access is to introduce a more hierarchical scheme, known as opportunis-
tic spectrum access. In opportunistic spectrum access, unlicensed devices can use
licensed spectrum as long as they do not interfere with licensed users.
In Chap. 1, we have discussed the CR as an intelligent control layer to han-
dle the increasing ﬂexibility, introduced by SDR and OSA. In this chapter, we
show two standardization efforts that are in line with this view. We ﬁrst present
the IEEE 802.21 Media-Independent Handover, which dictates how the a recon-
ﬁgurable radio can decide to switch between different standards. Afterwards we
discuss the IEEE DYSPAN Standards Committee (formerly SCC41), where tech-
niques are standardized in line with the CR paradigm to allow for a more advanced
adaptation and monitoring for Cognitive Radios.

2.2 Hardware Flexibility
Some of the major wireless standards are discussed to illustrate how increased ﬂex-
ibility and control is becoming abundant, even within a single wireless technol-
ogy. This demonstrates the diversity of the wireless scene, where many different
air interfaces and applications coexist. It is shown in Sect. 2.2 that within each
standard, the number of communication modes is increasing with each generation.
While standardization bodies do not discuss implementation, the number of modes
is increasing by such an amount that dedicated ASIC implementations become un-
realistic. First, the IEEE 802.11 generations are discussed focusing on the ﬂexi-
bility and control options within the standard. Afterwards, we discuss 3GPP-LTE
as the most prominent candidate for next generation cellular technology. Again,
for this class of standards, a trend exists towards more ﬂexibility and distributed
control.

2.2.1 IEEE 802.11: A Flexible Radio Becomes Smarter
Wireless Local Area Networking (WLAN) has always been the most important tech-
nology for wireless data solutions, although competition from the next generation
cellular technologies is increasing. The main standard for those WLAN networks
has been the IEEE 802.11 standard since 1999.
IEEE 802.11 speciﬁes a connectionless MAC on top of multiple PHY layers in
the unlicensed bands at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and recently also the 60 GHz band [20].
In this chapter, we ﬁrst give a short overview of the IEEE 802.11 standards in the
unlicensed bands below 6 GHz. Afterwards, the ﬂexibility offered by this standard
at PHY layer and the spectrum sharing options at MAC layer are discussed.
The initial 802.11 standard achieves a rate of 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz
band, while the 802.11b enhances this to support 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps. The
802.11a and 802.11g extensions allow up to 54 Mbps. The most recently standard-
ized physical layer is the 802.11n, which supports bitrates up to 600 Mbps thanks
to the use of advanced techniques including channel bonding, the use of multiple
spatial streams, aggressive coding, short guard intervals and optimized usage of all
subcarriers.
The next signiﬁcant update of the technology will be the 802.11ac standard,
adding even more advanced modulation and coding, up to 8 spatial streams and
channel bonding up to 160 MHz. With this continuing expansion of the number of
streams, channels bonded and modulation and code rates supported, the ﬂexibility
offered by the standard is increasing with each generation.
The MAC layer of the 802.11 standard only focuses on the channel coordina-
tion functions. In the baseline IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol description, a distributed
channel coordination function and a centrally controlled point coordination function
are speciﬁed. Both however do not provide sufﬁcient QoS guarantees. QoS exten-
sions are speciﬁed in the 802.11e standard.
The ﬂexibility offered by the WLAN standard will be exploited to illustrate con-
cepts for smart and cognitive radio design in this book. In Chap. 6 we focus mainly
on the physical layer ﬂexibility offered by the 802.11a standard. Considering the
modem, we rely on the implementation proposed in [21] with additional ﬂexibility.
This will already result in signiﬁcant energy and performance improvements when
the ﬂexibility is exploited smartly. For newer generation devices, the possible gains
are higher, at the cost of increased control complexity. Next, in Chap. 7 we focus
on the ﬂexibility of the MAC offered for the spectrum sharing. The MAC options
considered are applicable to the 802.11a/b/g/n standards, and most likely also the
new 802.11ac.
2.2.1.1 The IEEE 802.11a Physical Layer
The 802.11a physical layer has been introduced to achieve bitrates of up to 54 Mbps
in the 5 GHz bands. The modulation scheme used for 802.11a is OFDM, where

information is transmitted via multiple orthogonal subcarriers. For 802.11a, 48 sub-
carriers and 4 pilot subcarriers are used, covering a total of 20 MHz in bandwidth
including zero carriers. This modulation scheme is very effective for broadband,
hence high-speed, transmission since it efﬁciently handles the frequency selectiv-
ity of the channel. Moreover, it can be implemented elegantly using Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) and Inverse FFT (IFFT) digital blocks.
Eight transmission rates have been standardized (Table 2.2), making transmission
rate a possible control dimension. A transmission rate is set by conﬁguring both the
symbol modulation (NMod) and the Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate (Bc).
The current value chosen is communicated in the RATE ﬁeld in the Physical Layer
Convergence Protocol (PLCP) header of the PHY Protocol Data Unit (PPDU).
Finally, the output power PTx is limited to 30 dBm or 1 W. The output power can
be considered as a PHY control dimension, next to the already introduced digital
PHY control dimensions modulation and code rate. As the output power is a result
of the Power Ampliﬁer (PA) settings, it is referred to as an analog or front-end PHY
control dimension in the remainder of this book. In Chap. 6, we model the impact of
those control dimensions on the effective energy and performance, assuming a real-
istic implementation of the analog and digital modem. However, the output power
also has implications on the channel access of a CR, as is discussed in Chap. 7.
2.2.1.2 The IEEE 802.11n Physical Layer
The IEEE 802.11n standard supports data rates up to 600 Mbps. This is mainly
achieved using Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques, where up to
4 spatial streams are used in parallel. MIMO techniques that are supported by the
standards are space division multiplexing (SDM), transmitter beam-forming and
space-time block coding (STBC). The use of MIMO systems mainly increases the
throughput and coverage as compared to single antenna systems. Clearly, the possi-
bility to vary the MIMO scheme as function of throughput requirements and channel
condition can be considered to be a new ﬂexibility offered by the 802.11n PHY.
Next, the 802.11n offers the possibility to use up to 2 802.11a channels in par-
allel, which is referred to as channel bonding. As a result, the bandwidth can vary

2.2

15
between 20 and 40 MHz, which can be considered to be another new ﬂexibility
option. To increase the spectral efﬁciency even further, also at MAC level, several
optimization features have been added, such as frame aggregation or block acknowl-
edgments. Also, to improve the efﬁciency of the physical layer, a short guard inter-
val option is included, as well as advanced coding such as code rates up to 5
6 or the
option to use low density parity check (LDPC) coding.
2.2.1.3 The IEEE 802.11ac Physical Layer
The IEEE802.11ac Task Group has recently been formed within the IEEE802.11
Working Group. Its goal is to draft a standard for “Very High Throughput” WLANs,
with performances signiﬁcantly higher than those of the IEEE802.11n standard. Be-
cause the task group TGac has just started its activity, the standard is not yet avail-
able. TGac is currently drafting the detailed functional requirements. The trend of
802.11n towards more ﬂexibility in the MIMO options, channel bonding and more
spectrally efﬁcient physical layer options will however persist in the newest stan-
dard. More speciﬁcally, bandwidths up to 80 or 160 MHz will be supported. Also,
advanced multi-stream operation supporting up to 8 streams that can be destined for
multiple users is included in the specs. Finally, constellations up to 256 QAM are
being discussed.
2.2.1.4 Multiple Access Through Collision Avoidance with Carrier Sensing
We introduce the terminology and communication principles that are standardized
in the 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) baseline protocol description. Ac-
cording to the 802.11 standard, wireless networks can be arbitrarily complex, and
consist of a hierarchy of basic communication networks. A basic wireless com-
munication network is referred to as a Basic Service Set (BSS) which is a set of
stations controlled by a single Coordination Function (CF). The CF manages the ac-
cess to the radio channel. The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is manda-
tory for each BSS and is described ﬁrst. It standardizes a technique for distributed
contention-based channel access. The Point Coordination Function (PCF) for cen-
tralized contention-free channel access is optional. The PCF operation relies on the
DCF. To improve the QoS that can be achieved on top of 802.11 WLAN systems, the
Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) has been introduced to improve the baseline
DCF and PCF operations.
Further, a BSS can operate in Infrastructure mode (also referred to as regular
BSS), with an Access Point (AP) and multiple Stations (STAs). In this scenario,
the AP works as a bridge and every transmission is between AP and STA(s). Next,
the STAs can operate in Ad-Hoc mode, in which case the BSS is referred to as
Independent BSS (IBSS). In this scenario, there are multiple STAs, and no AP. Each
STA can be a router to connect the ad-hoc network to the wireline network.
The mandatory 802.11 DCF relies on a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Col-
lision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism. When a packet (i.e., MAC frame) is to

16
2
Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
be transmitted, the channel access procedure should be carried out. This channel
access relies on a constant sensing of the channel. The channel needs to be sensed
idle for a well-speciﬁed duration before the packet can be transmitted.
First, before each packet transmission, an Interframe Space (IFS) needs to be
considered. Then, to prevent STAs from accessing the channel simultaneously, a
random binary exponential backoff counter is introduced. Two different types of
channel or carrier sensing are standardized. The physical carrier-sense is provided
by the PHY, and depends on the PHY Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) procedure.
Further, a virtual carrier-sensing mechanism is provided by the MAC via a Network
Allocation Vector (NAV) counter. This counter can be set since each frame carries
the Duration ﬁeld in the header. Hence, any correctly received frame can result
in an update of that NAV counter, if the new NAV is larger than the current setting.
This NAV overrides the physical layer carrier sensing.
Wireless communication is sensitive to the so-called hidden node problem. It can
be seen in Fig. 2.2(a) that STA1 and STA3 can hear STA2, but they cannot hear each
other. As a result, their physical layer carrier sensing and their virtual carrier sensing
mechanisms cannot detect ongoing transmissions from each other. However, since
the interference range is typically at least as large as the transmission (and approx-
imately the carrier sense) range, they can interfere with, hence corrupt, ongoing
transmissions of each other. To prevent this, the collision avoidance mechanism has
been proposed (Figs. 2.2(b) and 2.2(c)). It consists of two short control frames that
are transmitted before each data frame transmission. The ﬁrst short control frame is
referred to as Request To Send (RTS), and is sent by the node that wants to trans-
mit a data frame (Fig. 2.2(b)). If the destination node received the RTS correctly,
it replies with a Clear To Send (CTS) message to inform the source it can send its
data frame (Fig. 2.2(c)). In the header, the total duration of the planned transac-
tion is listed. STA3, overhearing the CTS, can then set its NAV and delays channel
access for the total transaction duration. As a result, the hidden node problem is
solved. However, this RTS/CTS exchange results in a considerable additional proto-
col overhead for each data frame to be transmitted. As a result, it is not mandatory,
and is often dropped for short packet transmissions, more speciﬁcally for packets
that are smaller than the RTS Threshold.
It is clear that the hidden node problem can be solved by using a much lower CCA
threshold, or alternatively, transmitting the packets at a much higher power. The
impact of lowering the sensing threshold or the transmission power on the spatial
reuse is a complex problem and not well understood. It is very difﬁcult to derive
analytical models to predict the performance of a network for a given setting of
those thresholds, since the exact performance depends on a lot of parameters such
as trafﬁc density, exact topology etc. As a result, the optimal setting can only be
determined at run-time when more information about the exact operating conditions
is available. This will be illustrated in Chap. 7.
On top of the DCF, an optional PCF can be used. It enables a poll-and-response
MAC for nearly isochronous1 service. It can be used in the infrastructure BSS only,
1Isochronous refers to processes where data must be delivered within certain time constraints.

ance to solve it
since the Point Coordinator (PC) resides in the AP. When the PCF is deployed, chan-
nel access is organized in alternating Contention-Free Periods (CFP) and Contention
Periods (CP). The PCF suffers from unpredictable, and potentially very large, frame
transmission times. Once a station gets access to the channel, it can send a packet
up to 2312 Bytes. Assuming that the slowest transmission rate is used, this can take
up to 3 ms which is long. The lack of QoS guarantees on top of DCF and PCF has
prohibited the use of delay-sensitive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and
video conferencing on top of WLAN. To improve on this, the 802.11e has been
introduced. One of the mechanisms it includes to improve the QoS is the Trans-
mit Opportunity (TXOP), which is an interval of time when a STA has the right
to initiate transmissions. Once a TXOP is acquired, multiple (short) frames can be
transmitted. Further, if the TXOP is too small for the current transmission (e.g.,
since the transmission rate chosen is low), fragmentation needs to be carried out.

18

This is more fair in networks with varying transmission rates and packet sizes. As
long as the TXOP constraint is met, the smart radio can locally optimize it’s channel
access. In Chap. 6 it will be shown how this can be achieved on top of an 802.11a
PHY where the HCF Controlled Channel Access of IEEE 802.11e is used.
2.2.2 3GPP-LTE Evolutions
The 3GPP organization standardizes successive evolutions of cellular standards.
This includes ﬁrst 2G and 2G+ systems, which are were speciﬁed in various re-
leases from 3GPP, up to release 7.
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest standard in the 3GPP cellular standards
family. It is often referred to as a 4G standard, but it does not yet meat the IMT
advanced requirements for 4G since for instance the peak data rate requirement of
1 Gbps is not met. LTE is actually a 3.9G technology, a pre-4G standard and a very
important step towards LTE-advanced which is then the true 4G cellular standard.
The work on LTE advanced has started mid-2008 focusing of 4G solutions and it
is assumed to be standardized in the 3GPP speciﬁcation Release 10 [22]. The ﬁrst
publicly available LTE service was deployed in December 2009 in Scandinavia.
Denmark followed in 2010, while the mobile operators in the US announced a ﬁrst
roll-out only for 2011.
In this section, focus will be mainly on the LTE Rel 8, or the 3.9G of LTE. Then,
it will be summarized how LTE advanced builds on this technology.
2.2.2.1 The 3GPP-LTE Air Interface
LTE has ambitious goals with respect to data rates, coverage, latency, operation
costs, multi-antenna support, ﬂexibility and seamless integration. Speciﬁcally, the
goal is to achieve 100 Mbps in the downlink (DL) and 50 Mbps in the uplink (UL).
These peak data rates are based on the assumption that a single user is allocated
the whole bandwidth with the highest data rate modulation during a transmission
time interval (TTI = 1 ms). With different MIMO conﬁgurations (2×2, 4×4), these
peak data rates increase with the number of parallel streams transmitted. However,
when the number of active users in a cell increase, these rates will decrease.
LTE supports different multiple-antenna modes. The baseline conﬁguration of
the number of antennas for MIMO is 2 × 2. Also, 4 × 2 and 4 × 4 conﬁgurations
can be considered. In the DL, the supported modes are: spatial division multiplexing
(SDM), beamforming, and single-stream transmit diversity mode(s). In the transmit
diversity modes each antenna transmits the same information but possibly with dif-
ferent coding. Receive diversity is mandatory in LTE. A typical example is maxi-
mum ratio combining. These modes depend on the capabilities of the UE and the
number of receive antennas and should be adapted slowly to reduce control overhead
(at the beginning of the communication or at most every 100 ms). Thus switching

2.2
Hardware Flexibility
19
between MIMO modes is possible depending on channel conditions. In the UL,
MIMO schemes should be adapted to reduce complexity in the terminal. The base-
line is to have one transmit antenna to save cost and battery power. MU-MIMO can
be used. Multiple user terminals may transmit simultaneously on the same resource
block through spatial division multiple access (SDMA). The UEs sharing the same
resource block have to apply mutually orthogonal pilot patterns [23].
The physical layer of LTE uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
(OFDMA) in the DL and Single Carrier–Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-
FDMA) in the UL. OFDMA is a practical multiuser technique that allows data to
be sent to multiple users on a subcarrier-by-subcarrier basis. On the other hand, SC-
FDMA, being a single subcarrier system, offers the advantage of reducing the peak-
to-average-power-ratio (PAPR), hence increasing the transmitter RF power ampli-
ﬁer (PA) efﬁciency and reducing the power consumption of the terminal or User
Equipment (UE). The main difference between SC-FDMA and OFDMA is a DFT
processing block. In an SC-FDMA signal, each subcarrier used for transmission
contains information of all transmitted modulation symbols since the data has been
spread by the DFT over all the subcarriers. Oppositely, in OFDMA, each subcarrier
carries information from one modulation symbol [24].
LTE also allows for ﬂexible bandwidths going from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz [25].
The possibilities are: 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz, 20 MHz. It ap-
plies to both FDD and TDD. Half Duplex FDD is also supported. This allows opera-
tors to provide a whole suite of new services with different bandwidth allocations, or
in addition makes it possible to deploy LTE with high peak data rates even when the
spectrum availability does not allow for 20 MHz bands. Smaller bandwidths allow
for a more ﬂexible and even opportunistic frequency allocation.
Note that the transmission bandwidth is slightly smaller than the channel band-
width to allow a frequency separation from other bands. The sub-carrier spacing
is constant (15 kHz) regardless of the transmission bandwidth. To allow for opera-
tion in differently sized spectrum allocations, the transmission bandwidth is instead
varied by varying the number of PRBs which will be explained in Sect. 2.2.2.3.
In terms of mobility, LTE is optimized for low speeds (0–15 km/h). A high per-
formance should be achieved between 15 and 120 km/h. Mobility across the cellular
network should be maintained between 120 and 350 km/h (up to 500 km/h depend-
ing on the frequency band) [26].
2.2.2.2 Multiple Access in 3GPP-LTE
In this section, it is explained how the resources are used among users for a single
LTE cell, and among LTE cells. First, the OFDMA resource allocation is explained,
which results in a lot of degrees of freedom and hence opportunities to adapt to
the run time channel and load conditions of the different users. Next, frequency
planning is introduced. It is illustrated that an important trend exists to go from a
design time planning of the network toward a distributed planning of the network
during the run time, taking into account information that is only present during

Fig. 2.3 Flexible resource
allocation in time and
frequency for LTE
the run time. Finally, handover between cells is brieﬂy summarized, which is an
additional ﬂexibility present in current wireless networks.
LTE uses a time-frequency-space grid to allocate resources to users in the DL
and in the UL (Fig. 2.3). Users are allocated a certain number of resource blocks
consisting of 12 consecutive subcarriers during a time slot of 0.5 ms. In the time
domain, DL and UL transmissions are organized in radio frames of 10 ms, both for
TDD and FDD.
The same coding and modulation is applied to all groups of resource blocks be-
longing to the same L2 PDU (packets at MAC level) scheduled to one user within
one TTI (subframe) and within a single stream. Therefore, the smallest granularity
for assigning different modulations or proﬁles is 12 consecutive subcarriers during
a 1 ms period.
In total, each resource block (PRB) consists of 84 resource elements (12 sub-
carriers during 7 OFDM symbols). However, some of the resource elements within
a resource block will not be available as they are already occupied for reference
signals or control information.
Even though a downlink resource block is deﬁned in terms of PRBs the downlink
resource block assignment is carried out in terms of pairs of PRBs, where each pair

for inter-cell interference
(white denotes the central
region and the shaded regions

reuse)
consists of two, in the time domain, consecutive resource blocks within a subframe.
Additionally, QPSK is used for all control information and data can be transmitted
with different modulations like QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM.
Thanks to the ﬂexible resource allocation in time, frequency and space, and the
scalable bandwidths supported by LTE, it is expected that at least 200 users per
cell should be supported in the active state for a bandwidth of up to 5 MHz and at
least 400 users for higher bandwidths. More users are expected to be supported in a
passive (sleeping) state [26].
In a 20 MHz bandwidth, which is the maximum allowed bandwidth, up to 100
Resource Blocks (RB) could be allocated to different users (Table 2.3). A RB is
the minimum frequency-time unit allocated to a single user and consists of 12 sub-
carriers. Assuming 400 active users per cell should be supported, each user should
be allocated 1 RB every 4 consecutive sub-frames (1 ms TTI). The throughput per
user in this worst-case scenario will be around 250 kbps. This throughput is for the
downlink (DL) direction and will slightly decrease when considering the overhead
of the control information.
The cell-edge performance is a more challenging task since inter-cell interference
can degrade the system capacity. A way to limit this interference is through inter-
cell interference coordination, which can be achieved by restricting the transmission
power in different parts of the spectrum in combination with a ﬂexible frequency
planning. A possible ﬂexible frequency planning is a soft frequency reuse scheme
which is characterized by a frequency reuse factor 1 in the central region of a cell,
and a less efﬁcient frequency reuse near the cell edge as in Fig. 2.4.
When the mobile station (or UE) is near the base station (or eNB), the received
power of the user signal is strong, and the interference from other cells is weak. So
at the inner part of the cell, all the sub-carriers can be used to achieve high data rate
communication (Fig. 2.5).

22

Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
Fig. 2.5 Frequency planning
for inter-cell interference (the
entire band is used in all cells
for the central regions)
In Fig. 2.5, mobile stations 11 and 12 are connected with base station 1, while
mobile stations 21 and 22 are connected with base station 2, and mobile stations 31
and 32 are connected with base station 3. It can be noticed that mobile stations 11,
21 and 31 are located at the intersection of 3 cells, while mobile stations 12, 22 and
32 are in the center of their respective cells. For the three mobile stations at the cell
edge, different sub-carriers are allocated to avoid the co-channel interference. For
the mobile stations near the base station, all the sub-carriers can be allocated and a
lower output power can be used, to achieve a high frequency reuse. In this example,
the frequency reuse factor is 3 for the cell edge and 1 for the inner part of the cell.
For the inner part of the cell, through the limitation of the transmission power, some
isolated islands are formed that do not interference each other. To conclude, the
beneﬁts of using this ﬂexible frequency planning with soft frequency reuse scheme
are:
• High bitrate at the cell center;
• Less interference at the cell edge, making easier the channel estimation, synchro-
nization, and cell selection;
• Overall improved spectral efﬁciency of the network.
To achieve the beneﬁts of soft frequency reuse, a tight coupling between fre-
quency allocation and output power is needed. This can be achieved by a thorough
network planning carried out during the roll out phase of the network. However,
with the trend towards smaller and smaller cells, a more distributed approach to-
wards power and frequency planning is needed. In recent years, Self-management
(Self-X) technologies that fully automate the tasks of managing (i.e. conﬁguring,
monitoring, and optimizing) a cellular network are emerging as an important tool
in reducing costs for the service provider and will be a distinguishing feature of

2.3
Spectrum Access Flexibility
23
LTE networks. In [27] this Self-X technology is used for the self-conﬁguration of
fractional frequency reuse for LTE that uses only local information. Their solution
achieves a trade-off between locality of the information, optimality and stability of
the solution. This trend to move from design time planning of the network towards
self-conﬁguration during the run time, taking into account speciﬁc information that
can only be obtained during the run time, is the basis of the design methods proposed
in this book.
2.2.2.3 LTE-Advanced
LTE advanced is the push towards 4G wireless technologies. It aims to even further
data rates than LTE [24] in line with 4G requirements. The most important require-
ment is the very high data rate, which is 100 Mbps for high mobility and as high as
1 Gbps for low mobility. This low mobility mode is the focus, since LTE advanced
mainly aims at achieving high data rates. However, mobility support across the cel-
lular network up to 350 km/h (even up to 500 km/h depending on the frequency
band) is also included.
To achieve 1 Gbps, the bandwidth is increased up to 100 MHz. For backwards
compatibility with LTE, this is implemented by aggregating up to 5 carriers with a
bandwidth of 20 MHz. In addition, the number of spatial streams is increased up to
8 × 8 for DL and 4 × 4 for UL. Next to SDM, the MIMO modes include beamform-
ing to improve the performance at the cell edges. For this, multi-cell beamforming
is also possible, which means that multiple eNB’s cooperate to transmit data to a
cell edge user. In addition to cooperative multipoint transmissions, cell edge per-
formance can be improved by means of relaying. Both layer 1 and layer 3 relaying
is considered. The target spectrum efﬁciency is 30 bps/Hz for the downlink and
15 bps/Hz for the uplink. Finally, the number of active users that should be sup-
ported in a 5 MHz band is increased to 300.
To make optimum use of all the possible frequency bands, and with a ﬂexible
bandwidth up to 100 MHz, it is clear that the frequency planning and conﬁguration
is even more ﬂexible than for LTE. In addition to that, with relaying and multi-cell
beamforming, the number of possible transmission modes is increased dramatically.
As a result, the trend towards self-conﬁguration and self-optimization is supported
even more for LTE-advanced. Both ﬂexible spectrum usage and more Self-X are
important features of cognitive radio networking.
2.3 Spectrum Access Flexibility
Spectrum is becoming a major resource constraint when designing radio systems.
The accelerated deployment of broadband personal communication coupled with
the continuously increasing demand for large data rates results in an increasing spec-
trum scarcity. Wireless technology on the other hand is becoming more and more

24
2
Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
ﬂexible so that a more opportunistic use of the spectrum or air interface becomes
possible.
The need for, and possibility of, a more ﬂexible use of the spectrum is currently
recognized and investigated by the major regulatory/standardization bodies (IEEE,
ITU, ETSI, FCC, EC) as well as many national spectrum administrations. World-
wide, frequency bands are being opened up for more ﬂexible access. One well-
known example of this, is the debate on ﬂexible re-allocation of the so-called ‘dig-
ital dividend’ and ‘TV white spaces’ which is regularly grabbing headlines in the
media. A recent decision by the FCC to open up unused TV spectrum for unlicensed
use is fueling this debate even more. In Europe too, there is a call for more ambitious
use of the free spectrum space (e.g. through the WAPECS initiative).
In addition to this new trend towards an opportunistic use of spectrum by sec-
ondary users, the coexistence problem in the unlicensed bands in a well-known
problem that is not trivially solved. In this section, we discuss coexistence prob-
lems, both in the case of secondary and primary user coexistence in the TV white
spaces or licensed bands, and coexistence in the unlicensed bands. In this book, it
will be illustrated how to design more smart or cognitive radios based on a design
example for both coexistence scenarios. In Chap. 5 it will be shown how to improve
coexistence in the ISM bands. In Chap. 4 it will be shown how an opportunistic
radio can avoid interference with a licensed technology.
2.3.1 The ISM Band: Coexistence in Unlicensed Bands
Spectrum sharing in the unlicensed bands is based on a best effort principle, i.e.,
nodes are equipped with some mechanism to guide spectrum access in a distributed
way. However, no guarantees about the QoS can be set, and as a result it is com-
monly believed that spectrum sharing in the unlicensed bands offers a worse QoS
to the end user compared to licensed or ﬁxed access. The CR paradigm investi-
gates how more guarantees can be given when the spectrum is to be shared among
possibly heterogeneous technologies. This can for instance be achieved by making
more optimal use of the existing ﬂexibility options such as power control, rate adap-
tation or channel selection. In addition, the spectrum access in unlicensed bands
is typically guided by means of a Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) etiquette. This means
that node have to sense the channel before they can access it. A more optimal con-
ﬁguration of the LBT rules is another important conﬁguration knob to control the
spectrum access of a cognitive radio.
To explain the coexistence problem when heterogeneous networks with a similar
licensing status have to share the same spectrum, focus in this book is on the coexis-
tence between two major wireless standards that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band,
namely 802.11g Wireless LAN [28] and 802.15.4 Sensor Networks [29]. Their over-
lapping frequency channels are shown in Fig. 2.6. The characteristics of both net-
works are very different, resulting in a problem that is asymmetric in nature. Indeed,
the output power of 802.15.4 devices is typically as low as 0 dBm [30], whereas the

2.3

25
Fig. 2.6 802.11 and 802.15.4 channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band
output power of 802.11g devices is typically 15 dBm or above. Also, 802.15.4 sen-
sor networks are designed to monitor the environment or buildings, and can be very
large, while 802.11 networks are mostly local hotspots organized around an Ac-
cess Point (AP). Finally, sensor network applications are not demanding in terms
of throughput, which means that their duty cycle is relatively low. Because these
networks are very different in nature, achieving smooth coexistence between those
networks is not trivially achieved since that would require the detection and chan-
nel access techniques of both technologies being harmonized. While their operating
characteristics are very different, both rely on a LBT channel access mechanism.
Nevertheless, the LBT mechanism cannot give any guarantee about the caused in-
terference, and more cognitive adaptation will be needed to improve the coexistence
performance.
2.3.1.1 IEEE 802.11h for Spectrum and Transmit Power Management
Extensions
Interest in wireless technology has experienced explosive growth over the past
decade. Due to the ﬁnalization of many standards, the development of wireless
applications has eased, which has contributed to increased spectrum use by a va-
riety of heterogeneous devices, standards, and applications. This holds especially
true for the Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) bands that are unlicensed and
hence host the most heterogeneous mix of networks. To address the coexistence
problems in those bands, the IEEE has started the 802.11h Working Group to make
recommendations for better future coexistence [31]. It solves problems like interfer-
ence with satellites and radar using the same 5 GHz frequency band. It was origi-
nally designed to address European regulations but is now applicable in many other
countries. The standard provides Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and Transmit
Power Control (TPC) to the 802.11a MAC that especially coexists with radar sys-
tems. Both DFS and TPC will be used further in this book to improve coexistence
performance of a CR.

2.3.1.2 IEEE 802.19 Coexistence Technical Advisory Group
The IEEE 802.19 Technical Advisory Group deals with coexistence between un-
licensed networks, which is hence applicable to many of the IEEE 802 wireless
standards. The ﬁrst example of wireless coexistence was between IEEE 802.11 and
IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), both operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Coexistence
for those networks was ﬁrst addressed in the IEEE 802.15 Task Group, which pro-
duced a Recommended Practice on Coexistence of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth.
Since March 2006 the IEEE 802.19 TAG addresses coexistence between wireless
standards for unlicensed wireless networks under development within IEEE 802.
When a new standard (or amendment to a standard) for an unlicensed wireless net-
work is being developed the working group may develop a Coexistence Assurance
(CA) document that is reviewed the IEEE 802.19 TAG. At this moment, CA docu-
ments exist for IEEE 802.15.3c, IEEE 802.16h, IEEE 802.11y, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE
802.15.4a and IEEE 802.15.4b.
TV bands are generating a lot of fuss and interest within IEEE 802 because work-
ing groups like 802.11, 802.15, 802.16 and 802.22 have their eyes on this new (and
very good) part of the spectrum. The IEEE 802 Executive Committee approved the
formation of a “TV white space coexistence study group” in the 802.19 Coexistence
Technical Advisory Group. The Study Group stopped its activity after the March
2009 meeting. IEEE 802.11af is the new study group focusing on a PHY and MAC
for the TV bands.
2.3.2 The TV White Spaces: Spectrum Sharing in Licensed Bands
The main interest in the TV bands is driven by the worldwide switchover from
analogue to digital terrestrial TV which will release a large portion of spectrum
known as the “digital dividend”, and might also make available the guard bands
between existing or new broadcasting channels (the so-called TV White Spaces or
TVWS) available for opportunistic use. These frequency bands are very valuable as
they provide propagation characteristics that enable signals to penetrate thick walls
and travel long distances. The general consensus worldwide is that at least part of
this digital dividend and TVWS spectrum should be allocated for mobile broadband
services.
The debate on these so-called ‘white spaces’, is regularly grabbing headlines in
the media with a noticeable interest from and role for new players in the wireless
ﬁeld. The debates centers on the free use of White Space Devices (WSD), i.e. de-
vices that could opportunistically make use of free spectrum for various goals. Par-
ties in favor of these devices see major opportunities for the freed up spectrum,
including more mobile broadband services, offering better quality of service, to
more users. Traditional users of the freed-up spectrum bands and adjacent spectrum
bands such as broadcasters are concerned about the consequences of this type of un-
licensed use that could interfere with licensed use. They demand a highly regulated
approach.

2.3
Spectrum Access Flexibility
27
Fig. 2.7 Spatial reuse of the TV white spaces requires large safety margins to ensure that the
receive contour of the primary transmitter is protected
In the US, the FCC adopted rules for unlicensed use of television white spaces
already in 2008. This announcement was a major endorsement for Cognitive Radio
and will softly introduce spectrum sensing technologies in the market in the coming
years. The FCC has proposed to use geo-location technology as a primary mea-
sure to combat interference: i.e. to check in a database whether a certain frequency
band is available or not at a certain location before authorizing the unlicensed use.
However, the FCC also stipulates that the geo-location based devices should be
complemented with sensing technology:
The Commission also has required that devices include the ability to listen to the
airwaves to sense wireless microphones as an additional measure of protection for
these devices.
To implement reuse of the TV white spaces, from a platform point of view, the
main challenges are related to the sensing requirements. Indeed, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.7, it is impossible to sense the exact impact of the secondary transmitter on
the primary receiver that should be protected. It is only possible to sense the channel
from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter, and huge safety margins
are added in order to accommodate unknown blocking in the sensed channel. In-
deed, if the sensed channel would be blocked, the primary transmitter would seem
to be further away than it actually is, and the secondary transmitter could falsely
assume that the channel is free. For the TV white spaces, sensing up to −116 dBm
is hence targeted, which is well below the noise ﬂoor in those bands.
The FCC’s conclusion however stated that devices do not consistently sense TV or
wireless microphone signals and the transmitter is capable of causing interference
to these signals.
September 23, 2010, the FCC issued a Second Memorandum Opinion and Or-
der [32] determining the ﬁnal rules for the use of WSD. The new rules remove
the mandatory requirement that WSD should include sensing technology to detect
the signals of TV stations and low-power auxiliary service stations (wireless mi-
crophones). The FCC states that the geo-location and database access method and
other provisions of the rules will provide adequate and reliable protection for in-
cumbent devices, thus making spectrum sensing not necessary since this mandatory
requirement would not best serve the public interest. However, the FCC recognized
the value of sensing for TVWS in the following statement: We continue to believe
that spectrum sensing will continue to develop and improve. We anticipate that some

28
2
Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
form of spectrum sensing may very well be included in TVBDs on a voluntary basis
for purposes such as determining the quality of each channel relative to real and
potential interference sources and enhancing spectrum sharing among TVBDs.
Although spectrum sensing is no longer a mandatory requirement, the FCC has
still deﬁned the technical rules for its use. With regards to the geo-location database,
the key speciﬁcations are still to be drafted and some key issues clariﬁed, such as
how many databases will be in place, who will create and manage them, will they
public or closed, how will they be certiﬁed, and so on.
In Europe, work on a pan-European speciﬁcation for cognitive radio systems
(CRS) is taking place within the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)
of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations
(CEPT). In September 2010, a draft report [33] was released assessing the appro-
priateness of the sensing and geo-location techniques to provide protection to the
existing radio services in the context of a diversiﬁed range of envisaged deployment
scenarios for WSD. In this report, the spectrum sensing technique (local sensing
in which detection is carried out independently by each device) employed in this
study is regarded as not reliable enough to guarantee interference protection for
DTT receivers and programme-making and special events (PMSE) systems. In the
DTT scenario, spectrum sensing does not guarantee a reliable detection of the pres-
ence/absence of the broadcasting signals at the distance corresponding to the inter-
ference potential of a WSD. Therefore, the use of a geo-location database appears
to be more reliable in this scenario. In the case of the PMSE deployment scenarios,
temporal fading caused by multipath propagation is likely to be one of the main
factors affecting the ability of WSDs to protect PMSE systems from interference.
In some cases, this may lead to very low detection threshold, far below the WSD
receiver noise ﬂoor, making spectrum sensing techniques quite impractical. Thus,
the ECC argues that setting sensing thresholds very low in order to protect incum-
bent services, would result in increasing device cost and complexity as well as a
in reduced number of available channels. In its view, this would limit the commer-
cial deployment of WSD and reduce the potential value to end-users. Therefore,
the report concludes about the primary need to employ geo-location/database ac-
cess, since sensing alone would not guarantee interference protection. In case geo-
location/database access can provide sufﬁcient protection to the broadcast service,
sensing should not be a requirement, since its potential beneﬁt still needs to be fur-
ther assessed.
2.3.2.1 IEEE 802.22 Wireless Rural Access Networks
The IEEE 802.22 Working Group (WG) was formed in November 2004, after the
FCC released its Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) for the TV bands in May
2004. This WG was specifying an air interface (including PHY and MAC speciﬁ-
cations) for Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN) to coexist with legacy TV
transmission relying on cognitive capability. It was the ﬁrst standard designed for
opportunistic spectrum access, and hence the standard is summarized here. IEEE

2.3
Spectrum Access Flexibility
29
802.22 only focuses on ﬁxed devices, while the IEEE 802.22a is to add mobile and
portable device functionality to IEEE 802.22. First, the application domain is dis-
cussed brieﬂy, to better understand the ultimate goal of the standard and hence the
decisions made for spectrum sensing, analysis and decision. The main application
target for 802.22 systems is wireless broadband access in rural and remote areas.
Because of this speciﬁc rural application domain targeting lowly populated areas,
the success of the standard was low. However, the sensing features for opportunistic
spectrum usage introduced in the standard are interesting and hence brieﬂy summa-
rized in this chapter.
2.3.2.2 System Overview
The use of the lower frequency bands are particularly useful for rural access because
of the favorable propagation conditions encountered for those lower frequencies. Al-
though the population density is often very small in rural areas, large coverage areas
might render the deployment of 802.22 Base Stations (BSs) a proﬁtable business.
These lower frequency bands are licensed for TV broadcasting and Wireless Mi-
crophones. However, many TV channels are largely unoccupied in many parts of
the United States, and often TV is delivered through cable access or satellite. As a
result, opening up those bands for WRAN systems could make a good case, both
from business and technical points of view. Next to the main WRAN application
domain, 802.22 networks can also be used for smaller markets such as small busi-
nesses or home ofﬁces. But the main goal is delivering broadband to households in
rural areas.
An example of a deployed 802.22 network is given in Fig. 2.8. The 802.22 net-
works operate in a ﬁxed point-to-multi-point topology where a BS controls a cell
consisting of a number of Consumer Premise Equipments (CPEs). The BS is an en-
tity installed by an operator, and controls the cell strictly. Next to more traditional
medium access control, that addresses when to transmit, it decides on how CPEs
should access the spectrum. Moreover, the BS maintains control of a distributed
sensing strategy to keep track of potential primary users (TV or wireless micro-
phone signals). Clearly, it possible to have multiple 802.22 cells that interfere. This
is aggravated because of the very large transmission area of those systems. Coexis-
tence issues of 802.22 cells are hence also addressed in the 802.22 standard.
2.3.2.3 Spectrum Sensing
One of the important components of the IEEE 802.22 document to achieve the re-
quired cognitive capability is related to spectrum measurements. The spectrum mea-
surement in 802.22 is primarily based on transmitter detection. In order to check the
presence of primary signals, 802.22 devices need to be able to detect signals at very
low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Since the detection is done at low SNR, it
is assumed that the detection of TV signals is done in a non-coherent manner, which
means that no synchronization is needed [34].

30

Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
Fig. 2.8 802.22 deployment scenario
The required accuracy of the spectrum sensing, the frequency band and time pe-
riod, is determined in a centralized way by the BS. Using the local measurements,
the BS can establish a spectrum occupancy map. The BS does not require the same
sensing accuracy of each CPE, and algorithms to optimize or distribute the sensing
load across CPEs can be used. To optimize the sensing, 802.22 devices are sup-
posed to be equipped with a dedicated omni-directional antenna for sensing. This is
in addition to a directional antenna which is used for data transmission in the tar-
get direction, minimizing the interference area. To be able to optimize the sensing
accuracy of the omnidirectional antenna, it would most likely have to be mounted
outdoors [34]. 802.22 devices can be instructed to perform in-band or out-of-band
sensing, where a band denotes the TV band currently used by the cell. For in-band
sensing, the 802.22 communication needs to be temporarily halted, in order not to
interfere with the sensing. There clearly is a trade-off between speed at which a
primary TV signal can be detected, and the efﬁciency or throughput achieved by
the 802.22 cell. To avoid too frequent long connectivity halts, a two-phase sens-
ing mechanism is proposed (Fig. 2.9). Fast sensing, i.e. based on a simple and fast
sensing technique, is performed more frequently. After one (or more) fast sensing
periods, the BS can decide whether to perform a ﬁne sensing. This ﬁne sensing takes
more time but should in fact only be carried out if the fast sensing results are not
sufﬁcient to draw conclusions. Given the fact that TV signals do not come on the air
frequently, this two-phase sensing method proves highly effective [34].
If multiple 802.22 cells operate in the same area, it is required that their sens-
ing strategy is synchronized (i.e., they should halt communication when other cells
sense). Since coexistence among different 802.22 cells is an important issue, such
synchronization is embedded in the 802.22 standard. Contrary to the TV signals
detection, sensing of wireless microphone transmissions is much harder as these
transmit at a much lower power and occupy much lower bandwidths. Therefore, in
addition to transmitter detection, a second sensing option is enabled in the 802.22

31
Fig. 2.9 802.22 two-phase in-band sensing
standards. This second option relies on the transmission of beacons by the micro-
phones themselves or a special device carried by microphone operators. This pri-
mary network information monitoring is embedded in the 802.22 MAC.
The exact sensing algorithms to be used during the ﬁne and fast sensing periods
are not standardized, but an extensive list is provided as annex to the standard.
2.4 Operation Across Technologies: Cognitive Radio
In the previous section, coexistence between technologies was discussed. Optimal
sharing is achieved when technologies are not only aware or each others presence,
but also act as a function of the coexistence scenario and ideally cooperate. Cooper-
ation between different technologies was ﬁrst possible in the form of medium inde-
pendent handover. Although the handover capabilities were merely a responsibility
of the terminal, the fact that a standard and information sharing across technologies
is present, can be considered as a ﬁrst example of operation across technologies.
Current standards focusing on cognitive radio or dynamic spectrum access networks
are also discussed. These standards aim a step further towards the true seamless re-
conﬁguration of multiple terminals and networks. For these future standards, both
ETSI and IEEE initiatives are discussed.
2.4.1 Mobile Independent Handover: IEEE 802.21
This standard deﬁnes media access independent mechanisms that enable (especially
through link layer information) an efﬁcient handover between 802 mobile termi-
nals (capable of supporting different link-layer technologies) and may facilitate the
handover between 802 and cellular terminals. The coverage goes from the 802.15
pico-cells and the 802.11 micro-cells up to the 802.15 and 3GPP macro-cells with
overlapping coverage. This standard is intended to improve users’ experience of
mobile devices for 802 heterogeneous networks in a wired or wireless environment
and to allow a seamless handover, when the network conditions support it.
The media types that this standard supports include those speciﬁed by the IEEE
802 wired and wireless family of standards, as well as those speciﬁed by the Third

32
2
Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
Generation Project (3GPP), and Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2).
This standard also addresses the support for handover of mobile and stationary users.
As expected, handover for mobile users will happen when changes in the wireless
link conditions occur. Not so obvious is the case of stationary users. In general,
when one network becomes more attractive to another due to network environment
changes, a handover for a stationary user might occur, for example, when a user
starts an application that requires higher data rate channel. In any case, the handover
should be as transparent as possible to the user.
Furthermore, the IEEE 802.21 standard supports cooperative use of information
at the mobile node and within the network infrastructure. This means that both the
mobile node and the network can make decisions about connectivity based on mea-
surement reports supplied by the link layer. These reports may include metrics like
signal quality, synchronization time differences, and transmission error rates. It is
assumed that the mobile terminals and the points of attachment such as the base
stations and access points may be multimodal, i.e., capable of supporting multiple
radio standards and simultaneous connections on more than one radio interface.
2.4.2 Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks: IEEE DYSPAN
The IEEE 1900P standards committee was established in 2005, in order to promote
new standards and technologies for better spectrum management. It has been re-
organized as Standards Coordination Committee 41 (SCC41). In December 2010
all activities of SCC41 were transferred to the Communication Society Standards
(CSSB). And CSSB established a new committee to manage the SCC41 activities
under the new name. IEEE DYSPAN Standards Committee. Two working groups
are presented hereunder: 1900.4 and 1900.6, since they standardize the main fea-
tures of a CR. 1900.4 focuses on the cognitive control and how this should be bal-
anced between the network and the terminal. 1900.6 focuses on the information
gathering for a CR.
2.4.2.1 IEEE 1900.4
The task of IEEE 1900.4 working group is to develop a standard deﬁning “Archi-
tectural Building Blocks Enabling Network-Device Distributed Decision Making
for Optimized Radio Resource Usage in Heterogeneous Radio Access Networks”.
The objective is to improve the overall composite capacity and the quality-of-
service (QoS) of wireless systems in heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs).
To achieve this objective the standard deﬁnes network resource managers (NRM),
terminal resource managers (TRM) and the information to be exchanged between
NRM and TRM. This information exchange between network side entities and ter-
minal side entities (network-terminal distributed decision making) is exploited to
optimize the radio resource usage including spectrum access control in heteroge-
neous RANs.

2.4
Operation Across Technologies: Cognitive Radio
33
The standard is associated with the heterogeneous wireless environment which
includes multiple operators, multiple RANs, multiple radio interfaces and multiple
terminals.
NRM and TRM interact with each other and exchange the context information
measured at the network and the terminal side. This context information is exploited
for the network-terminal distributed optimization of the spectrum usage. The stan-
dard considers the reconﬁgurable base stations and reconﬁgurable mobile terminals.
Any network side radio node is called the base-station which can be a Wi-Fi access
pint (AP), a UMTS node-B or a WiMAX base station (BS) etc. The reconﬁgurable
terminals that are considered in the standard may or may not have multi-homing
capability, which refers to the capability of a reconﬁgurable mobile terminal to have
more than one simultaneously active connections with RANs.
The standard deﬁnes three use cases:
• Dynamic Spectrum Assignment: In this use case the frequency bands are dynam-
ically assigned to RANs. It means that the frequency bands are not ﬁxed and
can be dynamically changed to be used by RANs and terminals by an operator
spectrum manager (OSM).
Spectrum sharing and spectrum renting among RANs are examples of this
use case. In spectrum renting the frequency bands of one RAN is assigned to the
other RAN. In spectrum sharing the frequency band of a particular RAN is shared
among several RANs. For example a frequency band previously used for WiFi
(IEEE 802.11) wireless Internet access can be shared/rented to mobile broadband
wireless access WiMAX (IEEE 802.16).
• Dynamic Spectrum Sharing: In this use case ﬁxed frequency bands can be dynam-
ically assigned to RANs and terminals. The frequency bands assigned to RANs
are ﬁxed but can be shared among several RANs.
As an example of such use case might be the opportunistic spectrum access of
unlicensed secondary systems (IEEE 802.22 or unlicensed WLAN IEEE 802.11
in a possible future CR environments) with the primary licensed but un-utilized
part of VHF/UHF spectrum in time or space.
• Distributed Radio Resource Usage Optimization: In this use case the decision
making is done in a distributed manner by the network and the terminal.
An example of this use case may be the scenario in which the context of the
CWN changes e.g. network load is increased or decreased, change in the channel
fading statistics and the availability of a high throughput/user preferable RAN
etc. In such a case the TRM analyze the context information and dynamically
make its own decisions to optimize the radio resource usage, QoS and its own
objectives.
According to the standard there shall be an entity on network side, called
Network Reconﬁguration Manager (NRM), responsible for managing the CWN
and Terminals for network-terminal-distributed optimization of spectrum usage.
There shall be an entity on terminal side, called Terminal Reconﬁguration Manager
(TRM), responsible for managing the terminal for network-terminal-distributed op-
timization of spectrum usage. The TRM shall manage the terminal within the frame-
work deﬁned by the NRM and in a manner consistent with user’s preferences and

34

Emerging Standards for Smart Radios: Enabling Tomorrow’s Operation
available context information. This evolution towards policy derivation by the NRM
that will guide the TRM do execute it’s cognitive control mechanisms in a way that
are in line with the overall network objectives is an important enabler for CR. In ad-
dition to the decision framework, the entities for information extraction, collection
and storage have been standardized. Also for this functionality, it is assumed that
TRM and NRM cooperate.
From April 2009, 1900.4 Working Group works on two projects:
• 1900.4a: Standard for Architectural Building Blocks Enabling Network-Device
Distributed Decision Making for Optimized Radio Resource Usage in Hetero-
geneous Wireless Access Networks – Amendment: Architecture and Interfaces
for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks in White Space Frequency Bands. This
working group hence focuses on the extension of the 1900.4 standard for the TV
White Spaces speciﬁcally.
• 1900.4.1: Standard for Interfaces and Protocols Enabling Distributed Decision
Making for Optimized Radio Resource Usage in Heterogeneous Wireless Net-
works. This standard targets the next step with respect to the cognitive control
standardization.
2.4.2.2 1900.6
The intended standard deﬁnes the information exchange between spectrum sensors
and their clients in radio communication systems. The logical interface and sup-
porting data structures used for information exchange are deﬁned abstractly without
constraining the sensing technology, client design, or data link between sensor and
client. The standard deﬁnes a Cognitive Engine (CE), a Data Archive (DA) and
a Sensor, and deﬁnes all logical interfaces between those entities. This deﬁnition
is hence in line with various approaches for obtaining information about spectrum
use, such as local sensing, distributed sensing or geo-location database. The stan-
dardized interfaces are very general to facilitate any sensing hardware, algorithm of
architecture. A follow-up project for the 1900.6 working group is under discussion,
to see how the standard can be instantiated for more practical sensing approaches or
geo-location database.
2.4.3 Reconﬁgurable Radio Systems: ETSI RSS
Similar to the IEEE DYSPAN initiative, the ETSI standardization is starting to stan-
dardize Reconﬁgurable Radio Systems. RRS is a generic concept to exploit the ca-
pabilities of reconﬁgurable radio and networks for self-adaptation to a dynamically-
changing environment with the aim of improving supply chain, equipment and spec-
trum utilization. The Technical Committee has four working groups on System As-
pects, Radio Equipment Architecture, Functional Architecture and Cognitive Pilot

Channel (CPC) and Public Safety. For the hardware ﬂexibility, it is mainly the Ra-
dio Equipment Architecture working group that is interesting. About the cognitive
control, the Functional Architecture and CPC are the most important initiatives. It
is worth to mention that the CPC is an alternative to the sensing or geo-location
database approaches. It allows a CR to obtain information about available services
and the spectrum use by means of listening to a dedicated channel. The CPC was pri-
marily a European alternative for the CR control and information sharing problem.
In [35] it was shown that third-party approaches to facilitate a CR operation clearly
have their drawbacks since the current stakeholders in the wireless landscape of
course do not like to rely on such a third party for their services. Similar arguments
can be considered for the geo-location database that is most likely or possibly also
going to require a third party (such as e.g. Google).

Chapter 3
Cognitive Radio Design and Operation:
Mastering the Complexity in a Systematic Way
3.1 The Need for a Strategy
Wireless communication networks are complex and dynamic systems. So many
variables and uncertainties related to the environment and user requirements ex-
ist, which makes it extremely difﬁcult to derive effective static control strategies. As
a result, wireless devices need to become increasingly smart by allowing dynamic
strategies that are able to track the changes in the network and adapt accordingly.
While the trend towards more ﬂexibility both in terms of hardware and policy ﬂex-
ibility was already introduced elaborately in Chap. 1, this chapter focuses on the
smart control this implies.
Several challenges need to be addressed when designing efﬁcient control algo-
rithms for these ﬂexible radios. Indeed, next-generation radios and networks need to
be smart to exploit the opportunity of their ﬂexibility. However, while dumb strate-
gies can be readily and efﬁciently implemented, more complex control strategies
pose a burden on the run-time complexity for these radios. Hence, wireless devices
need to be smart at two layers: they need to be smart to exploit the dynamics of
their environment and they need to be designed in a smart way so that the run-time
complexity remains acceptable.
In this chapter, we demonstrate a general control strategy that is able to adapt
ﬂexibly to the environment without heavily impacting the run-time complexity. In
the subsequent chapters, this strategy is instantiated for case studies to emphasize
different aspects of the general framework.
The method proposed in this book can be roughly divided into a design time and
a run time process. The degree of intelligence and adaptation enabled in the run
time process typically determines how smart the radio is. As deﬁned in Chap. 1,
a radio is only cognitive when it learns based on feedback from the environment.
It will be shown that the run time involves four main tasks: monitoring or observ-
ing, determining the current scenario, acting on the scenario following a procedure
and ﬁnally learning or calibrating the procedure. In the remainder of this book, a
case study will then be presented that involves each of the four tasks, but however,
emphasis will be on one of the tasks:

Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
• Observe RT situation: The challenge in sufﬁciently observing the RT scenario is
the most prevalent in cases where Primary Users (PU) and Secondary Users (SU)
have to coexist in an OSA scenario. In Chap. 4 the ﬂow will hence be instantiated
in a PU/SU scenario with special focus on the RT monitoring.
• Map RT Situation to scenario: Very often several sources of information have
to be combined to sufﬁciently understand the current scenario and act effectively.
This will be shown in a case study of IEEE 802.15.4 coexisting with IEEE 802.11,
where the goal of the IEEE 802.15.4 network is to ﬁnd a single channel that is
least interfered by IEEE 802.11. Routing layer information, together with PHY
layer sensing information, will be combined to enable the IEEE 802.15.4 network
to ﬁnd its single best channel.
• Execute RT Procedure: The execution of a well-deﬁned RT procedure does not
necessary require a radio to be cognitive. However, it will be shown that the pro-
posed ﬂow can still be used to achieve a run-time efﬁcient design of smart radios
that adapt to their environment. The context will be an IEEE 802.11 network in
which multiple users coexist and have to share the medium, while meeting per-
formance constraints and minimizing energy cost.
• Calibrate and learn RT Procedure: The most important task of a cognitive ra-
dio is learning and calibrating how it behaves in the environment. How to achieve
this efﬁciently is illustrated in the context of IEEE 802.11 networks that aim at
minimizing the co-channel interference in a distributed way by adapting the out-
put power, sensing threshold and transmission parameters.
This chapter illustrates the generic design ﬂow that will then be instantiated in the
next chapters. First, the design landscape is completely described in Sect. 3.2. While
Chap. 1 focused mainly on hardware and policy ﬂexibility, it is shown in Sect. 3.3
that the involved challenges for the control solution are even broader. Finally, in
Sect. 3.4 the proposed design framework is then introduced.
3.2 The Design Landscape Is No Longer Flat
The purpose of this section is to explain the design landscape for the control of
wireless devices and networks. The easiest systems to optimize are those that have
limited dynamism.1 They can be approximated at DT by static models typically
designed for the worst case. Hence, relying on these static DT models, the system
can be conﬁgured completely at DT and does not need to be changed at RT.
However, as we will further detail in this chapter, wireless networks are ex-
tremely dynamic and, hence, DT-only frameworks for wireless networks, which al-
ways need to be designed based on the worst case operating conditions, are severely
suboptimal. Therefore, wireless networks ask for a more elaborate framework that
1A system is said to have limited dynamism if mean(FoM)
max(FoM) > (1 −ϵ), when using a static conﬁg-
uration that optimizes mean(FoM). FoM denotes the Figure of Merit at RT and ϵ is some small
quantity.

Design Challenges and Opportunities

tracks the dynamics at RT and adapts to the locally observed changes in the environ-
ment. Still, most industrial designers today implement their solutions in a DT-only
way due to the reduced manual effort and the limited tool support to go beyond such
a DT-only approach. In this book, however, we assume that this isn’t the case for the
development of wireless devices.
As explained in Chap. 1, next-generation terminals will operate in increasingly
complex scenarios, where interoperability and coexistence will become key con-
cerns. The CR paradigm proposes a framework to address these challenges. Due to
the increased dynamics and the difﬁculties faced at DT to model these elaborate co-
existence scenarios, Dr. Joseph Mitola III has stated that the ultimate CR would rely
on a RT-only framework [15]. Such a RT-only framework would not use a single
DT model and, hence, inaccuracies in these models wouldn’t propagate to the con-
trol procedure used at RT. Furthermore, a RT-only framework would be extremely
ﬂexible as each new scenario is learned through experience and interaction with the
environment. Unfortunately, the RT algorithms to explore each situation and future
evolutions in a holistic way require enormous learning overhead today. Hence, in
this chapter, we propose a hybrid DT/RT framework to exploit the potential of the
ever increasing ﬂexibility without increasing overhead to unacceptable levels.
We propose to model dynamic systems as a sequence of scenarios. Then DT pro-
cedures are built, relying on these DT models. At RT, the RT situation is efﬁciently
monitored and mapped to a speciﬁc DT scenario, after which the DT procedure
linked with the observed scenario is executed. However, in line with the CR vision,
the framework then calibrates these procedures to learn new RT procedures based
on interaction with the environment.
3.3 Design Challenges and Opportunities
In this section, we present an overview of the main design challenges and opportu-
nities in the context of wireless networks. In the next sections, we then detail how
these challenges are addressed by our proposed framework.
3.3.1 Design Time Complexity
The goal of a smart radio is to adapt its operation to the dynamic environment con-
ditions and user requirements. This is a very challenging task that requires a global
approach. Indeed, all layers of a single terminal should be included (going from
the ﬂexibility at hardware level all the way to applications running on top of it). In
addition, because of the sharing, the interactions of all other users should be consid-
ered. Considering the global problem during the design of the smart radio is hence
very complex, and a good modeling, veriﬁcation and testing of the design is a very
challenging task. This is a driving force behind the search for cognitive radios, since

40
3
Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
an ultimate cognitive radio would learn how to adapt during the run-time to the en-
vironment and application, making the number of design decisions that should be
taken by the engineers signiﬁcantly smaller.
However, it should be clear that an ultimate software radio does not exist, and the
radio operations will always be constrained by the dimensioning of the hardware.
While it is possible to design for instance analog SDR solutions that are very ﬂexi-
ble (see [36]), the tuning range is of course bounded and discrete. Similarly, for the
digital part, it would be too costly in terms of area and power if the SDR would be
designed a virtually unbounded number of possible operations and complexity bud-
get. The design of SDR or CR is hence maybe even more challenging compared to
the design of traditional ASIC solutions. Indeed, instead of a use case scenario, the
designer should be familiar with a broad range of use case scenarios and modes and
achieve an optimal design, on average, for the good mix of scenarios and modes.
How to determine that good mix, how to trade-off the performance of each individ-
ual scenario or mode in that mix, and the run-time choice between different modes
and scenarios are all new design questions that did not need to be addressed in tra-
ditional designs. Clearly, there is a need for a more systematic design ﬂow, which is
the goal of this book/chapter.
Next to the complexity caused by the different modes and scenarios, a large part
of the design time complexity is caused by the fact that the problem is inherently
multi-dimensional. For instance, a baseband design for SDR is characterized in
terms of power, area, performance and ﬂexibility. A better design in one dimen-
sion is typically performing worst on the other dimensions. Selecting the optimal
trade-off in this multi-dimensional design space is very difﬁcult since it requires
balancing standardization, regulation, business aspects and good engineering. None
of these aspects can however be omitted when a successful design of a smart radio
is targeted.
3.3.2 The Mountains We Have to Climb
Wireless networks are complex and dynamic systems. First of all the environment
in which they operate is becoming increasingly dynamic, since wireless networks
are becoming more popular and, thus, dense. Furthermore, a broad range of appli-
cations has to be supported, resulting in heterogeneous performance constraints. In
this section, we detail some of the dynamics faced in wireless networks.
3.3.2.1 Channel Dynamics
Wireless channel dynamics are studied extensively in literature [37]. The consid-
ered coherence time, i.e., the time duration over which the channel is expected to
remain stable with a given probability, can range from the duration of a symbol or bit

3.3
Design Challenges and Opportunities
41
at physical layer to the scheduling period at medium access control layer [38]. De-
pending on the exact degree of the dynamics (i.e., coherence time), different adapta-
tion strategies are optimal. For instance, when time variations can be tracked timely,
it is optimal to adapt accordingly. However, when variations are too fast, diversity
techniques are very powerful. It is however widely accepted that the coherence time
for indoor and stationary users can easily be larger than 100 ms (see Chap. 6). This
implies that channel variations are fast, but it is still possible to track these variations
in the lower layers.
Besides variations in time expressed by the coherence time, channels are typi-
cally also varying over frequency. This variation is captured in the coherence band-
width, and frequency-adaptive techniques exist [37] in case the communication
channel bandwidth is larger than the coherence bandwidth.
Finally, the channel is varying in space. This last variation means that different
users in the same network often see a very different channel since they are located
in a slightly different spot. Furthermore, the use of multiple antennas on a single de-
vice exactly exploits the fact that both antennas see a different channel since they are
separated in space [39]. Variations over space will be exploited to improve the mon-
itoring in Chap. 4 and to make the RT procedure more energy efﬁcient in Chap. 6.
Solutions should hence be robust to the channel variations in time, frequency and
space.
3.3.2.2 Application Dynamics
Networked applications communicate in packet bursts that are transmitted over the
communication network. Such bursty behavior is typically more difﬁcult to track
and to predict compared to more continuous variations. Next to packet burstiness
within application streams, the average bitrate requirements can differ a lot from
application to application.
Different applications are also sensitive to different performance aspects. Real-
time streaming applications prefer strict delay guarantees for a frame, while ﬁle
transfer is best served by maximizing the average throughput, hence total ﬁle down-
load delay. Sensor networking applications are typically not throughput intensive.
For those applications, delay and robustness against failure are the most important
performance aspects.
3.3.2.3 Network Dynamics
Mobile networks do not necessarily rely on an extended infrastructure to operate and
can be established on the ﬂy, i.e., in an ad-hoc way. Alternatively, in infrastructure
mode, the network changes as terminals join and leave the network. As a result,
devices can take part in networks of virtually any size or topology, and the number
of users in the network will vary over time. Solutions should therefore be able to
optimize networks of different size or topology. Network dynamism is limited by

42
3
Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
users’ mobility. A terminal remains connected to a single network for seconds (a
phone call, while driving) to several hours (WLAN in the home).
When dynamics are slow, the system can be observed through events. For net-
work dynamics, such an event would for instance be a terminal joining the network.
Between events, a system can be approximated as being static.
In Chap. 7 it will be illustrated how to adapt the network parameters to improve
coexistence with other networks of the same type. In Chap. 5 the coexistence prob-
lem of IEEE 802.15.4 networks with dynamic IEEE 802.11 networks will be con-
sidered.
3.3.3 The Sharing Challenge
Throughout this book, the sharing problem is a key driver for the control challenge
and, hence, the need for a systematic ﬂow. It is not sufﬁcient to solely consider the
impact of a local decision, e.g., decreasing the transmission rate, to evaluate local
performance. Thus, the results of the proposed framework in its global environment
are considered: a single network consisting of multiple users, different networks
sharing a same channel, different heterogeneous sharing the ISM band and ﬁnally
the case where primary and secondary users coexist.
In this section we brieﬂy discuss three challenges related to sharing in a wireless
context: the spectrum policy, multi-user interaction and fairness.
3.3.3.1 The Spectrum Policy
Like water, air or oil, the wireless spectrum is a shared resource. This however does
not imply that it should be free! Indeed, the base of all economics is scarcity and we
have already shown above that wireless spectrum appears to be very scarce today
and is, hence, expensive.
As mentioned in Chap. 1, the apparent spectrum scarcity and the success of the
ISM bands has coerced regulatory bodies into deﬁning a roadmap towards more
local and organic policies for sharing the wireless spectrum. Today, policies cover
large areas and remain static over years. The end goal of the regulatory roadmap is
to increase the policy dynamism to days, hours or even minutes. This implies that
future terminals will operate in a diverse environment, where they can act amongst
equal, superior and inferior terminals from a policy point of view.
3.3.3.2 Multi-user Interaction
Wireless devices and networks operating in the same frequency bands interact. Sim-
ilar to channel dynamics, multi-user interaction or interference has an impact on the
channel quality. However, unlike channel dynamics, interference dynamics are cre-
ated by the actions of radiating objects in the vicinity (microwave ovens, wireless

3.3
Design Challenges and Opportunities
43
terminals inside or outside the network, ...). Increased interference results in an in-
creased packet error rate at the physical layer or an increased packet collision rate at
the MAC layer. For the user, the competition for the spectrum results in an increased
channel access delay or a lowered achieved throughput. The impact of the detailed
actions of each other terminal in the network has a huge impact on the achieved
performance and is hence the main reason why current radios should adapt, intelli-
gently.
3.3.3.3 Fairness
Wireless spectrum is a shared resource. This, however, does not imply that every-
body has the same access to it. For instance, while water is a shared resource, in
a remote village in Africa it is generally more difﬁcult to access water than in a
European town. Unfairness can however be compensated, for instance by installing
better irrigation systems in Africa.
Similarly, some wireless devices may experience good channel conditions, while
others are experiencing worse situations. This unfairness can be compensated by
allowing users with bad channels to access the spectrum longer. Unfairness can
also be caused by a disparity of different application requirements. We have, for
instance, shown that energy-sensitive wireless devices can throttle the performance
of throughput-sensitive devices when both can access the spectrum equally [19]. Is
it fair that energy-sensitive users conserve energy, at the expense of the throughput-
sensitive users?
This question is difﬁcult to answer as today fairness criteria2 remain very am-
biguous and local. A strong debate is ongoing to ﬁnd a unifying fairness deﬁnition.
Only when this debate closes and such a deﬁnition is found, can fairness be truly
regarded as an objective.
3.3.4 Run-Time Complexity
We have shown that the global design problem is very challenging. However, the
goal remains to design an efﬁcient run-time procedure for a radio that can be exe-
cuted on a handheld, mobile smart or cognitive radio. Wireless communication de-
vices are typically small and battery-operated devices. Hence, algorithms designed
for these devices should be run with limited computation resources. Combining the
inherent complexity with limited capabilities is the last challenge that should be ad-
dressed. The focus of this book is mainly on the run-time operation, that consists
of four phases as already introduced in the introduction of this chapter: observing
the RT situation, determining the scenario, executing the RT procedure and ﬁnally
2For instance, in wireless networks a plethora of fairness indices are currently being used. We refer
interested readers to [40, 41].

44

calibrating or learning the RT procedure. The full framework, including design time
and run time phases, is introduced next.
3.4 Proposed Control Framework
The ultimate CR is built on a RT-only framework and, hence, does not rely on any
DT model. As a result, modeling inaccuracies will not propagate to the control pro-
cedure at RT. Furthermore, a RT-only framework will be extremely ﬂexible as each
scenario is learned through experience and interaction with the environment. Unfor-
tunately, RT algorithms to explore each situation and future evolutions in a holistic
way require enormous overhead. On the other hand, DT-only frameworks based on
worst-case operating conditions, are known to be severely suboptimal for dynamic
wireless networks.
In this book, we present a framework that can exploit the ﬂexibility, while main-
taining an acceptable complexity level. This framework relies on design control pro-
cedures at DT, that are efﬁciently executed at RT. This allows for an effective and
efﬁcient RT operation. However, as the control procedures are built relying on DT
models, inaccuracies in these DT models may propagate to the control procedure.
Furthermore, creating DT models is becoming increasingly complex as wireless
terminals are facing very complex environments. In line with the CR paradigm, we
also embed a learning module to compensate these inaccuracies and to ﬁnd suitable
operating points even in unforeseen situations.
This section is structured as follows. First, we detail the general design concepts
in Sect. 3.4.1. In Sect. 3.4.2, we describe the design ﬂow. Finally, the RT operation
is detailed in Sect. 3.4.3.
3.4.1 General Design Concepts
In this section, we describe the general design concepts of our framework. In
Fig. 3.1, a condensed version of our proposed framework is shown. First, we
describe the impact of the increased ﬂexibility provided by the SDR and OSA
paradigms on our control framework. Then, we discuss environment awareness and
why it is critical in the development of future CR systems. Finally, we discuss how
we can learn from extended interaction with the environment.
3.4.1.1 Control Dimensions
The quest for the ultimate CR is driven by new paradigms that increase the HW ﬂex-
ibility (SDR) en the policy ﬂexibility (OSA). As a result, the set of RT adjustable
control dimensions (also referred to as knobs) of a wireless terminal is steadily in-
creasing. It is important to rely on this knob set to reconﬁgure the system at RT. The

Fig. 3.1 A condensed version of the proposed framework. DT procedures that are established
from DT models observe the RT situations and map this to a scenario. The DT procedure linked
with the observed scenario is calibrated at RT by the RT learning engine
goal of the proposed framework is to dynamically select the conﬁguration of those
knobs to address the user’s (or operator’s) needs. The more knobs available to effec-
tively control the system, the more gains can be achieved when using the presented
framework.
In this book, it is assumed that knobs are available (see Chap. 1). As we are
concerned with developing the CR, a control layer, the development of protocols or
implementation techniques that make those knobs available are outside the scope of
this work.
3.4.1.2 Environment Awareness
Both Haykin and Mitola identiﬁed environment awareness as a key element for fu-
ture CR systems. Indeed, a wireless device today does not operate independently but
acts within a larger environment. Awareness of this environment does not imply you
can understand it, which is the ultimate goal of a CR. However, the opposite does
hold: understanding an environment can’t be achieved without closely monitoring
it!
When a wireless device monitors the environment, it can map observations to
an environment model, created at DT. This presumes that the environment can be
at least partly analyzed and modeled at DT. Such a model should however be very
parameterized and even abstracted to a high level. This is usually feasible as we
show in subsequent case study chapters.
In this way, we avoid having to do everything at RT (which provides too much
RT execution overhead) or everything at DT (which is too complex in practice or

46
3
Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
involves worst case design margins). Based on the hybrid information, the CR can
then synthesize the combined model of the environment at RT.
3.4.1.3 Efﬁcient and Effective Calibration at Run-Time
Especially in best-effort systems or when system constraints are soft, wireless termi-
nals are allowed to do even more than passively monitor and track the environment.
Based on feedback from the environment, they can explore and learn the behavior
and response of the environment, while calibrating the DT control procedures.
The essential information, needed to learn and calibrate, is the feedback from the
environment. While monitoring is passive, feedback concerns action (from the ter-
minal) and reaction (from the environment). A CR can only truly start understanding
its environment, when it is able to interact and observe the environment response.
Unsurprisingly, Haykin stated: “... therefore the CR is, by necessity, an example of
a feedback communication system” [17].
Exploration and learning allow to compensate for difﬁculties faced at DT mod-
eling. As we explain below, at DT we cluster different RT situations into system
scenarios. For each system scenario, a DT procedure is then designed. By calibrat-
ing the DT procedure for the observed scenario, we customize the DT procedure
towards the observed RT situation and, hence, further gains can be achieved.
3.4.2 Design-Time Flow
In this section, we present the different steps to be taken at DT. As illustrated in
Fig. 3.2, the ﬁrst step is modeling. After this, control dimensions of the system and
environment dynamics are identiﬁed. These control settings are then mapped onto
the objective space. Next, we cluster the space into a small set of system scenarios
and deﬁne rules how these system scenarios can be identiﬁed at RT. The ﬁnal result
of the DT ﬂow is a DT procedure for each system scenario. Below, we explain these
steps in further detail.
3.4.2.1 Design-Time Modeling①
Any DT procedure can only be seeded by what is known at DT. Both system and
environment need to be modeled at DT to represent the important characteristics and
relations. The introduction of the SDR has increased the ﬂexibility of the wireless
terminal and, hence, makes these harder to model. However, as the whole system
can be observed in lab environment, it is relatively easy to evaluate and validate
system models.
The environment is however more difﬁcult to simulate in a lab environment. Due
to many multi-user interactions the environments faced by wireless terminals are

3.4

47
Fig. 3.2 The proposed framework separates DT and RT. While the DT part is a feed-forward process, the RT is a feedback process. This feedback process is
essential for CR systems to calibrate and learn procedures at RT

48
3
Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
becoming very complex. To make an appropriate DT model, we need to predict at
DT, what kind of environments the wireless terminal will face and model these en-
vironments. This task is very cumbersome, which is the main reason why validation
of research results is evolving from simple channel models over network simula-
tors [42] to elaborate real-life testbeds, e.g., the ORBIT grid of WinLab [43], the
IBBT iLab.t [44] or the BOWL project of TU Berlin [45]. The task of validating re-
search results remains very important! However full validation cannot realistically
be achieved at DT anymore. As a result, the framework should be ﬂexible enough
to adapt to new and unforeseen RT situations. This is heavily supported by the CR
paradigm.
3.4.2.2 Identify Control Dimensions②
One of the assumptions of the framework is the availability of control dimensions
or knobs to control or steer the system’s performance. The focus of this work is on
the radio knobs, so the lower communication layers, so no transport and application
layer knobs are considered. The number of knobs available in a system, and the
range to set them can be implementation dependent. As a control layer to handle
a wide variety of control dimensions, the CR is pushing systems to extend their
control dimensions.
Control Dimensions (Knobs): (Ki,j), 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤k. For a given wire-
less network architecture consisting of n terminals, k control knobs or dimensions
exist for each terminal, such as modulation, code rate, output power. The control di-
mension settings are discrete in real implementations, inter-dependent and together
have a complex non-linear inﬂuence. We deﬁne a setting of all knobs j for terminal
i to be conﬁguration point Ki.
In this book, we also consider actions. Actions represent a change over time,
from one knob setting to the other. As the system can only control the knobs, it is
the only way of acting and interacting with the environment.
Actions: (Ai), 1 ≤i ≤n. For all n wireless terminals, an action at time tk is
deﬁned as the relative change in its conﬁguration point from tk to tk+1: Ai|tk =
(Ki|tk →Ki|tk+1). The actions are selected by the RT procedure and are used to
exploit and explore the environment.
3.4.2.3 Identify Dynamics③
As discussed above, the dynamics of the wireless environment are the main drivers
to establish an elaborate hybrid DT/RT framework that allows adaptation to these
dynamics. The important dynamics are those that inﬂuence the performance of the
wireless terminal signiﬁcantly. These should be identiﬁed and represented in the
environment model.
Dynamics are often difﬁcult to model, especially those resulting from multi-user
interactions. In [46], we have illustrated this for large-scale IEEE 802.11 networks.
It is hence important to provide procedures ﬂexible enough to adapt their behavior
at RT to account for modeling inaccuracies at DT.

3.4
Proposed Control Framework
49
3.4.2.4 Mapping to Objective Space④
The identiﬁed knobs and environment dynamics can be mapped to an objective
space. In this objective space each combination of a certain environment and knob
setting corresponds to one point, representing the obtained performance values for
all objectives. For best-effort systems, absolute mapping is not necessary. Rather, the
actions and environment can be mapped to a marginal objective space which means
that actions correspond to an improvement on a certain dimension rather than an
absolute performance, which is usually easier to deﬁne. An example is for instance
a delay constraint: for real-time systems, the delay constraint is a hard constraint,
while for best effort systems, the delay constraint is often relative.
3.4.2.5 Cluster and Monitor System Scenarios⑤⑥
In traditional scenario-based design, a scenario describes the use of a future system,
in an early phase of the development process. Typically, they appear like narrative
descriptions of envisioned usage episodes, called use-case scenarios. As in [19, 47],
we consider a different and complementary type of scenarios, called system scenar-
ios. These scenarios are used to reduce the system cost by using information about
what can happen at RT to make better design decisions at DT and to exploit the
time-varying behavior at RT.
System scenarios are the result of a clustering process in the (marginal) objective
space and, hence, group RT situations, which have similar performance characteris-
tics (as a function of the knob settings). At RT these system scenarios then need to
be able to be monitored and identiﬁed. The scenario should be selected that is closest
to the current system state. Clearly, a trade-off exists between adaptation accuracy
and the number of system states that need to be considered. Each additional system
scenario results into memory and monitoring overhead. However, more scenarios
result into better adaptation and, hence, increased gains.
System scenario: (Si,m), 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤m ≤s. As wireless terminals are operat-
ing in very dynamic environments, the system behavior varies over time s. Environ-
mental or application dynamics independent of the user or system’s control exist,
represented by the system scenario variable, Si,m.
Monitors: (Mi), 1 ≤i ≤m. For a given wireless environment, m monitors can
be deﬁned. A monitor is an explicit observation of an independent parameter of
the observed RT situation. An independent parameter denotes a parameter that the
wireless terminal cannot inﬂuence. As a result, monitors are a function of the en-
vironment and the environment only. This is in contrast to the feedback, which we
formally deﬁne later in the chapter. Unlike a monitor, the feedback is a function
of the environment and the actions taken by the wireless terminal and allows RT
calibration.

3.4.2.6 Determine DT Procedure⑦
Finally, a DT procedure is developed. As mentioned before, the DT procedure
should be generic enough (parameterizable) to be able to efﬁciently handle as many
RT situations as possible. The RT procedure can be expressed as a ﬁxed procedure
that should be carried out. Alternative, the procedure can be deﬁned in a way that
enables run time learning or calibration. The RT learning engine then adapts the
DT procedure according to the encountered RT situation, which is learned through
feedback. A DT procedure is established for each possible scenario. The DT proce-
dure outputs an action distribution, which has to be tuned based on feedback, as a
function of the environment.
For instance, in Chap. 7 we introduce the hidden terminal starvation problem.
For this scenario, we know that the actions: increase rate, increase carrier sense
threshold and decrease power are dominated by their antagonists. The DT procedure
for this scenario would then look like:
p(decrease transmission rate) = 0,
(3.1)
p(increase transmission rate) = α1,
(3.2)
p(decrease carrier sense threshold) = α2,
(3.3)
p(increase carrier sense threshold) = 0,
(3.4)
p(increase transmit power) = α3,
(3.5)
p(decrease transmit power) = 0,
(3.6)
where α1...3 are the parameters the RT learning engine needs to learn for the ob-
served RT situation.
Alternatively, in Chap. 6 we deﬁne a RT procedure for the energy-efﬁcient trans-
mission of multiple terminals in a single wireless network. The RT procedure in that
case will be deﬁned completely at DT assuming that the environment, hardware and
multi-user interaction can be sufﬁciently isolated at DT.
Due to switching cost, it can be suboptimal for the terminal to change its behav-
ior after it has detected a scenario change. Hence, possible gains should always be
compared with the cost needed to switch from one DT procedure to another.
3.4.3 Run-Time Operation
The challenge at RT is to determine, for each user, the optimal conﬁguration. This
requires to monitor the environment, to identify the observed scenario, to execute
the RT procedure and to calibrate it. As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter,
the different steps in the RT ﬂow are the most important in the smart and cognitive
radio operation. As a result, in each of the following chapters, different case studies
will be introduced that focus each more on a speciﬁc step of the RT ﬂow.

3.4
Proposed Control Framework
51
3.4.3.1 Observe the RT Situation①
First, the environment is observed with the monitors, deﬁned at DT. In general, the
information to monitor and to be taken into account by the deﬁnition process of the
smart radio can also be calibrated or partially learned at DT. This is however not
considered in this book.
The monitoring of the environment is very important in the context of Oppor-
tunistic Spectrum Access, which was probably the ﬁrst well known example of the
cognitive radio paradigm. In this use case, smart radios are called secondary users
and have to closely monitor the use of the spectrum by primary users. If a primary
user is present in a certain area, the spectrum cannot be used by the secondary user.
This simple monitor and act, although the simplest instantiation of the framework
introduced in this book, is one of the most known cases of cognitive radio.
3.4.3.2 Map RT Situation to System Scenario②
The encountered scenario is then mapped to a speciﬁc system scenario, based on the
information derived from the monitors. The observed system scenario gives input to
the RT procedure, that is executed and possibly calibrated or even partially learned
even at DT. Potentially, the selection of system scenarios can also be calibrated or
learned. This is however not considered in this book as we only calibrate the RT
procedure (see Fig. 3.2).
A given scenario is often only determined uniquely when monitors across layers
and possibly even different nodes are combined. In this book, this will be illustrated
for the case of an IEEE 802.15.4 network coexisting with an IEEE 802.11 network.
For the IEEE 802.15.4 network to ﬁnd it’s globally optimal channel, it is needed to
monitor both the physical layer interference and the routing parameters.
3.4.3.3 Execute RT Procedure③
The RT procedure determines the action to be taken in each of the given scenarios.
An action can be an absolute setting of a knob to a value, or a relative increase of the
knob setting. For instance, it is possible to give an output power value for the PA, or
rather an action can be speciﬁed as increasing the output power of the PA with 2 dB.
The actions that should be taken by the smart radio can be fully determined at
DT, or only partially speciﬁed. In the latter case, the RT procedure is calibrated or
learned at RT by means of feedback.
In its most generic version, the RT procedure is hence a function of the current
environment, the observed feedback history and the DT procedure.
A RT procedure that is fully characterized at DT is illustrated in Chap. 6. The
considered use case is an IEEE 802.11 network where multiple users have to share
the medium. By means of scheduling, the power-performance of the entire network
is optimized, based on a RT procedure fully speciﬁed at DT.

Cognitive Radio Design and Operation
3.4.3.4 The RT Procedure④
When the RT procedure is not fully deﬁned at RT, it is needed to learn and calibrate
the actions to be taken. However, to enable learning and calibration, we need to have
feedback. As mentioned above, feedback is crucial to develop CR systems. Based on
feedback from the environment, CR systems can explore and learn the behavior and
response of the environment. Based on this behavior and response the underlying
environment models are adapted and new RT procedures can be deﬁned.
Feedback is linguistically deﬁned as [48]:
1. “the process of returning part of the output of a circuit, system, or device to the
input, either to oppose the input (negative feedback) or to aid the input (positive
feedback)”,
2. “a reaction or response to a particular process or activity”,
3. “evaluative information derived from such a reaction or response”.
Rather than monitors that passively observe the environment, feedback gives infor-
mation about the environment through its reaction on an action taken by the wireless
terminal.
Feedback Channel: (Fi), 1 ≤i ≤f . For a given wireless environment, f feed-
back channels can be deﬁned. Rather than passive monitoring, feedback contains
information about how the environment reacts to speciﬁc actions taken by the wire-
less terminal. Rather than directly observing the parameters of the RT situations, a
feedback channel observes the effect of the actions taken by the wireless terminal
on the environment.
As mentioned above, the RT learning engine calibrates the template of the DT
procedure. In the example considered in this book in Chap. 7, reinforcement learning
is used for the calibration.
The objective of the RT calibration is to ﬁnd the action that yields the most re-
ward. It is interesting to see that learning algorithms learn a procedure, but do not
dictate whether this procedure should be used or not. Exploration beyond the cur-
rent RT procedure is not only allowed, but advised. Traditionally, this exploration
is done blindly. The major problem with blind learning algorithms is the need to
explore all possible actions. As a result these algorithms scale badly.
By allowing the DT procedure to steer the exploration of the algorithm away
from dominated operating points and by deﬁning possible actions, the number of
points that the learning engine needs to traverse can be signiﬁcantly reduced. Ideally,
the DT procedure presents one point, the optimal, which is the case when the RT
environment is well known and easily modeled (see Chap. 6). However, as discussed
above, for wireless networks this is not feasible anymore.
Reinforcement learning captures the most important aspects of the real prob-
lem facing a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal [49].
Contrary to supervised learning, which learns from examples provided by a genie,
and costly techniques, such as neural networks or simulated annealing that rely on
the availability of a test set, reinforcement learning learns from interaction with the
environment. In interactive problems it is often impractical to obtain examples of

3.5
Conclusions
53
desired behavior that are both correct and representative of all the RT situations in
which the agent has to act. In uncharted territory, an agent must be able to learn
from experience. This makes these reinforcement techniques extremely suited for
CR systems.
This case study can be considered as part of a larger trend toward greater con-
tact between artiﬁcial intelligence and other engineering disciplines. Obviously, the
ultimate CR would be a prime example of such symbiosis.
3.5 Conclusions
In this chapter we have introduced the main challenges in the design of CR systems.
It has been shown that those challenges result in a rich set of new design opportu-
nities. We have also given an overview of the system design landscape and moti-
vated our selection for a hybrid DT/RT framework. Afterwards, we introduced our
cognitive framework for distributed optimization of best-effort systems. A detailed
design ﬂow has then been speciﬁed to design systems according to this cognitive
framework.
In the remainder of this book, focus will be on the RT steps of the proposed
framework. As already mentioned in the introduction, four case studies will be con-
sidered that focus on each of the steps: observe RT situation, map RT situation to
system scenario, execute RT procedure and ﬁnally learn and calibrate the RT proce-
dure.

Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic
Radios
4.1 To Not Interfere
This chapter focuses on the monitoring challenge that is faced by opportunistic ra-
dios. First, the exact problem context of this chapter is introduced. Next, it is illus-
trated where this ﬁts into the cognitive design ﬂow introduced in Chap. 3. Finally,
some measurements are given to emphasize the complexity of this problem.
4.1.1 Problem Context
To solve the spectrum scarcity problem, the reuse of licensed spectrum when it is
locally not in use is receiving more and more attention. When such sharing is con-
sidered, it is very important that the secondary users adapt their transmission power
optimally so that they don’t harm the primary user, but simultaneously maximize the
throughput of the secondary network. The straightforward approach for this prob-
lem is to adapt the transmission power based on local sensing or monitoring or make
use of a geolocation database information. The sensing puts signiﬁcant sensitivity
requirements on the sensing device, and moreover requires taking into account large
design margins to account for worst-case fading and shadowing of the sensing de-
vice (see Fig. 4.1). The database approach relaxes the sensitivity requirements, but
is a static approach that is expected to also consider signiﬁcant margins.
To improve spatial planning of networks, this chapter introduces a distributed
and practical monitoring algorithm that
(a) relaxes the sensitivity requirements and hence allows for less expensive hard-
ware and more practical deployments,
(b) achieves optimal power allocation as a function of actual and arbitrary propaga-
tion conditions.
Moreover, it will be shown that the algorithm scales well and is robust against mea-
surement noise. Distributed or enhanced monitoring is an important enabler for an

Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic Radios
Fig. 4.1 Spatial reuse in wireless networks requires high sensitivity receivers and moreover never
achieves optimal adaptation to the real propagation conditions, since safety margins are needed to
avoid interference to the potential receivers with unknown channels. We want to achieve optimal
spatial reuse (i.e., without safety margins that limit the gain), while relaxing the receiver sensitivity
constraints
opportunistic radio. The discussed technique could be used to communicate actual
run time propagation contours of (TV) transmitters and improve on the overly con-
servative power estimates based on design time assumptions.
The challenges of efﬁcient spatial reuse are also illustrated by means of mea-
surements of an outdoor IEEE 802.11 network where one Access Point (AP) is
considered to be a primary AP and a second AP should avoid interfering with it.
The technique relies on the availability of nodal positioning information which
could be obtained through GPS measurements or a localization algorithm. Future
radios are expected to have geolocation capabilities, so this assumption does not put
additional constraints on the cognitive radio. When determining the optimal power,
a limited amount of interference from control messages is tolerated.
4.1.2 Smart Aspect
The cognitive aspect of the proposed technique lies in the fact that the environment
is monitored extensively. The environment in this case is the distance to the primary
user receive contour, or more importantly the actual pathloss that is a function of
distance but also shadowing. Within that contour, no secondary interference can be
tolerated. The secondary network will iteratively adjust it’s transmission power until
the coverage of the secondary network is within a certain predeﬁned bound of the
primary contour. If overlap of the contours is determined, the power will of course
be decreased. This means three scenarios are possible: decrease output power, keep
output power or increase output power. For each scenario, the corresponding action
is then taken until the algorithm converges. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.2.
The approach also relies on a DT model of pathloss and shadowing, that is then
calibrated at run-time to determine the actual shadowing, distance and pathloss ex-
ponent between the cognitive radio and the primary transmitter. Since explicit feed-
back is not possible from the primary transmitter (considered to be legacy tech-
nology), the information for this calibration is determined based on the monitoring

4.1
To Not Interfere
57
Fig. 4.2 Focus of this chapter is on the monitoring challenge for cognitive radio. The actions
are setting the power of the Opportunistic Radio, and these actions are a direct consequence of the
monitored environment and a model that translates this environment to a power setting. This model
was determined at design time and is not learned by the Opportunistic Radio
information. The algorithm is explained further in this chapter. First, some measure-
ments are discussed to illustrate the complexity of the problem.
4.1.3 Outdoor 802.11 Measurements
When designing the contour estimation and propagation method, it is important to
make the correct assumptions. Typically, wireless propagation is characterized by
means of a distance-dependent pathloss or trend. On top of this trend, shadowing
losses are added that are assumed slowly varying. Finally, fast fading due to mul-
tipath effects introduces variations at very small timescales. The impact of each
of those components is veriﬁed through measurements. This motivates the general
contour monitoring method.
4.1.3.1 Measurement Setup
Measurements were obtained from the outdoor 802.11 network at the UC Berkeley
campus. A highly accurate GPS receiver (with an error below 1 m) provides location
information. Since this is very accurate compared to the pathloss measurements,
positioning errors will be neglected. At each location, the Received Signal Strength
Indication (RSSI) is obtained which is a measure of received power for each beacon
received from the various 802.11 Access Points (AP) on campus.
A reconstructed contour using the algorithm introduced later for one of the APs
is shown on the left of Fig. 4.3. The two graphs in the middle and the right of the

Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic Radios
Fig. 4.3 RSSI measurements for an outdoor 802.11 antenna located on top of Cory Hall at UC
Berkeley. The left image shows the resulting contours for a given RSSI threshold, as we will com-
pute in this chapter. The two right images show measurement points and denoised RSSI signals
with 95% conﬁdence intervals for two different slices. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to
the RSSI contour threshold on the left image. Note the high noise levels, the absence of a clear
trend and the very different results along the two directions
ﬁgure show pathloss measurements along the slices indicated on the left overview
image. Each of the continuous pathloss curves in Fig. 4.3 is obtained by computing
for each point along the horizontal axis a local moving average (details are discussed
in Sect. 4.3.2). Along with the moving average the variance is computed, and hence
95% conﬁdence intervals (assuming the error is normally distributed), as indicated
in the ﬁgures.
4.1.3.2 Observations from Measurements
From these measurements, the following observations can be made.
No Clear Trend:
As can be seen in the slices drawn from the measured signal
strength in Fig. 4.3, it is not possible to ﬁnd a clear trend in the pathloss as function
of distance. Reception can degrade signiﬁcantly behind a building, and then improve
again at larger distances when the line-of-sight is established again.
Anisotropic Due to Shadowing:
As shown in Fig. 4.3, the propagation trend
looks very different along the two different paths. It can hence be concluded that
it is not possible to ﬁt a single trend to the measurements. Instead we need to ﬁt
local trends at run-time, not relying on the assumption that a single model ﬁts the
entire propagation surface properly.
Noisy Measurements Due to Fast Fading:
The RSSI sample points in Fig. 4.3
appear very noisy. A technique is needed to locally smooth out the noise and obtain
the solid curve along with associated conﬁdence intervals.
The main conclusions drawn from the measurements are that:
(1) there is no clear global trend,
(2) propagation conditions vary signiﬁcantly depending on the direction (since ob-
stacles vary depending on the exact path followed) and
(3) measurements are very noisy.
Clearly, it is very difﬁcult to propose a single pathloss or shadowing model at design
time that would ﬁt any run time condition. In this chapter a local channel estimation

4.2
The Sensing Problem
59
strategy is proposed to address both (1) and (3). Next, a technique is presented to
communicate the local estimate through the network and achieve a power control
considering not only distance, but also direction as motivated by conclusion (2).
The techniques are based on a design time model that is calibrated at run time based
on the monitoring carried out by the cognitive radio.
4.2 The Sensing Problem
Controlling or adapting spectrum use in space is typically achieved using Trans-
mit Power Control (TPC). Many techniques have been proposed to achieve optimal
power control through central coordination or in a distributed setting [50]. Each of
these techniques however requires a detailed knowledge of the propagation condi-
tions of two conﬂicting transmitters towards their intended receivers. When it is not
possible to rely on such channel state feedback from the receivers, this information
is typically obtained through sensing for transmitters. To detect potentially shad-
owed existing transmitters, the sensitivity requirements of secondary transmitters
needs to be set very high [51]. Even when the required sensitivity can be achieved,
the allowed power for the secondary transmitter is typically much lower than the
power that could actually be tolerated by the primary receiver since large safety
margins are required to account for unpredictable shadowing. Indeed, as illustrated
in Fig. 4.1, the channel sensed between the primary and secondary transmitter only
reﬂects the channel characteristics along this speciﬁc path and safety margins need
to be introduced to avoid interference along other paths towards the receivers. An
alternative approach is the so-called geolocation database.
4.3 Distributed Distance-to-Contour Estimation
4.3.1 Algorithm Overview and Design Decisions
The problem that should be solved can be stated as follows. For each potential
secondary transmitter, this cognitive secondary transmitter should compute its al-
lowable transmission power, so that a maximum number of receiving nodes can
be reached without interfering with (potentially multiple) primary transmitters. In
the following discussion motivates that this amounts to minimizing received power
contour-to-contour distances.
On a high level the algorithm works as follows. First, nodes which sense the
primary transmitter compute a robust estimate of the local RSSI. Next, the short-
est distance to the interior nodes, i.e., nodes within the propagation contour or with
RSSI above a given threshold, is propagated through the network. This distance can
be used by a secondary transmitter to conservatively estimate an initial transmission
power. Next, the secondary transmitter iteratively estimates the minimal distance

60
4
Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic Radios
between the primary signal threshold contour and its own secondary interference
threshold contour and uses this contour-to-contour distance along with a local esti-
mate of the pathloss model to adapt its transmission power to improve the spatial
reuse gain.
The design decisions for these three steps which are based on the aforementioned
observations in real-world wireless networks are introduced here. The algorithmic
details will be discussed in Sects. 4.3.2, 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.
4.3.1.1 Local Channel Estimation
Adapting the spatial resource allocations at the time-scale of fast fading is difﬁcult
to achieve in practical scenarios when the time to communicate a change is often
much longer than the time during which the change is in effect. The importance of
averaging out those fast-fading effects for power control was already noted in [52],
where the number of samples needed to achieve a target conﬁdence interval of the
slow pathloss estimate is computed for a theoretical fading model.
Since the goal is using power control for spatial resource optimization, it is also
required to average out variations over small areas. Large-scale distance-related
pathloss and shadowing due to large objects result in large effects that should be
considered in the spatial planning. However, fast fading due to multipath effects
gives rise to very large variations over distances in the order of a single wavelength.
Similar to the motivation above where fast fading effects make it impossible to adapt
timely, it is clear that spatial planning using power control cannot take advantage of
channel variations over very small areas.
In addition to averaging over time, the secondary transmitter will hence perform
(Sect. 4.3.2) a spatial Moving Least Squares (MLS) to obtain a local estimate
ˆ
RSSI
of the received power measure RSSI. MLS is a powerful regression technique to
smooth out noise, while obtaining the best local ﬁt of the propagation trend. As
mentioned also in [53], and veriﬁed by our measurements, it is impossible to rely
on a known propagation trend, so ﬁtting this trend adaptively and locally without
relying on any false model proves to be a very robust approach.
4.3.1.2 Distance-to-Contour Flooding
Propagating or broadcasting information in a network is typically achieved through
ﬂooding. In [54] it is shown that in ad hoc wireless networks, the more important
cost factor for ﬂooding is the number of packet forwardings and it is important to
prune away unnecessary transmissions.
For reporting a measured value to a sink, many schemes have been proposed
in the literature in the context of sensor networks [55]. An interesting approach is
found in [56], where the authors study the problem of delivering messages from
any sensor to an interested client user along the minimum-cost path in a large sen-
sor network. For a single client, they can establish the optimal cost ﬁeld with N

4.3
Distributed Distance-to-Contour Estimation
61
messages, through the use of a clever backoff approach. This approach establishes
a tree from any sensor to a client. In this chapter a similar algorithm will be used
to propagate pathloss information from any receiver to any potential transmitter,
hence conceptually resulting in a forest of trees. The resulting ﬂooding method as
detailed in Sect. 4.3.3 requires a number of packet forwardings close to the number
of nodes N.
4.3.1.3 Iterative Power Control
When each secondary transmitter knows its distance to the ﬁrst transmitter’s con-
tour, it can compute its maximal power as function of the interference margins and
a worst-case design time pathloss model as function of distance. From a secondary
transmitter’s viewpoint, a worst-case pathloss model is a pessimistic one that as-
sumes that the power of the secondary transmitter decays slowly, resulting in maxi-
mal interference. Consequently, the computed power level will be much lower than
what could be tolerated in reality.
Using the approach of contour estimation and distance ﬂooding, it is however
possible to iteratively adapt the distance between the two contours. While estimat-
ing the contour of the secondary transmitter, it is also possible to estimate a more re-
alistic pathloss model which in turn can be used to improve the power estimate. Key
here is to estimate the pathloss in the direction of the point closest to the ﬁrst trans-
mitter’s contour. Since the pathloss model can vary signiﬁcantly as a function of the
exact path followed, this direction gives the best information for the targeted power
control. As will be shown in Sect. 4.3.4, this iterative power adjustment algorithm
will converge in only a few steps and will require an order of N communications.
4.3.2 Local Channel Estimation
In this section, it is detailed how a smart secondary transmitter can locally smooth
the fast RSSI variations, without relying on a global trend or any prior informa-
tion, which allows robust inside/outside classiﬁcation with respect to the threshold
contour.
Given a node Ni at location xi, with received (noisy) power measure RSSIi, the
objective is to ﬁnd the noise-reduced power
ˆ
RSSIi. Given a complete polynomial
basis p(x) = [1 x ... xn]T , the cognitive transmitter tries to ﬁnd the coefﬁcient
vector ˆai which minimizes following weighted least squares objective function:
ˆai = argmin
a

j
wij(aT p(xj) −RSSIj)2,
(4.1)
where the summation is over Ni’s neighboring nodes Nj (with positions xj). Note
that Ni is contained in its own neighborhood. For example, the complete polynomial
basis of order n = 1 in two dimensions is p(x) = [1 x y]T and the coefﬁcient vector

62
4
Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic Radios
a = [a0 a1 a2]T consists of three unknowns. Results will be given for moving least
squares approximations of order n = 0,1 and 2.
The ﬁltered RSSI at the node Ni is then given by:
ˆ
RSSIi = ˆaT
i p(xi).
(4.2)
Locality is obtained by weighting the neighboring nodes’ contributions using the
distance-based weight function wij with local support h:
wij =

(1 −r2
ij)3
if rij ≤1,
0
otherwise,
(4.3)
where rij = (∥xi −xj∥)/h.
So, although in practice it is only needed to ﬁt a bi-variate polynomial at each
nodal position, the resulting
ˆ
RSSI is deﬁned everywhere and will be C2-continuous
thanks to the above deﬁned smoothly vanishing weight function. This weight func-
tion decays fast enough to establish a true local ﬁt [57]. Note that each smart node
computes its smoothed
ˆ
RSSIi estimate independently and only requires local RSSI
and GPS localization information to do so, which can be obtained by a single com-
munication step with its neighboring nodes if h is equal or smaller than the com-
munication range of the secondary network users. In the remainder, we will assume
that h is the communication range. This step hence requires N communications in
the network.
It is easy to see that for order n = 0, the minimizer of Eq. 4.1 equals the weighted
average measured RSSI:
ˆ
RSSIi =

j wijRSSIj

j wij
,
(4.4)
and thus the moving least squares approximation coincides with the well-known
moving average approximation method.
Intuitively, when the main goal of the smoothing operation is to average out spa-
tial variations, the moving average will result in adequate results. Alternatively, in
case larger neighborhoods are used and more measurement points are collected, it
might make sense to ﬁt a local trend (e.g., linear or quadratic). Such a trend will
reduce the smoothing effect on the one hand, but will improve accuracy on the other
hand since there are more degrees of freedom for the parameters. This is illustrated
in Fig. 4.4, left, using a simulated scenario (see also Sect. 4.3.5) where there is
a known contour with a systematically increased noisiness of the RSSI measure-
ments. As can be seen on the ﬁgure, when less smoothing is required (less noise
power), a quadratic MLS approximates the propagation surface best. However, with
increasing noise power more smoothing is required and linear and constant MLS
start to outperform.
Choosing the order of approximation as function of the neighborhood size is a
delicate trade-off. The choice of local support h as used in Eq. 4.3 inﬂuences the
approximation quality. As shown in Fig. 4.4, right, an optimal kernel width can be
found for all approximation orders and the optimal width typically increases with
approximation order.

Fig. 4.4 Left: Average squared error of the moving least squares approximation (with ﬁxed sup-
port radius h) for increasing noise power illustrated for order n = 0,1,2. At low noise levels,
quadratic MLS is superior, while with increasing noise levels, linear and then constant MLS have
better performance. Right: Average squared error of the moving least squares approximation (with
ﬁxed noise power of 4) for varying kernel widths shown for order n = 0,1,2. Clearly, an optimal
communication range h can be found for each approximation order
For the real-world RSSI measurements a noise power of σN = 4 was observed.
At this noise level, quadratic MLS with kernel width or communication range of
95 m proved to be the best (cf. Fig. 4.4) and these settings are further used for the
simulation results provided in the following sections.
4.3.3 Distance-to-Contour Flooding
A node is now classiﬁed as interior with respect to the threshold contour if
ˆ
RSSIi ≥
RSSIcontour. By determining the distance of each node to the closest interior nodes,
it is possible to establish an estimate of the shortest distance to the contour. From
this distance one can then iteratively approximate the transmit power, as will be
explained in Sect. 4.3.4.
A fast marching algorithm will be used which bears similarities to Dijkstra’s
shortest path algorithm. However, instead of computing a multihop distance, a
straight line distance will be computed to the contour, which is possible when GPS
coordinates are available. First, the centralized algorithm based on a priority queue
is discussed. Next, an approach is presented to make it fully distributed.
4.3.3.1 Centralized Distance-to-Contour Computation
During the execution of the algorithm each node Ni stores its distance di to the
closest interior node, or footpoint fi, inside the contour. The algorithm starts by
setting di ←0 and fi ←xi for all interior nodes. The distance for all other nodes is
set to inﬁnity (di ←∞). The nodes with di = 0 are added to a priority queue, which
is sorted in increasing distance to contour order.

64
4
Distributed Monitoring for Opportunistic Radios
The algorithm proceeds iteratively by taking the ﬁrst node Ni from the queue
(i.e., the one with the smallest di), and by updating its neighboring nodes Nj (those
within a communication distance h to Ni). The footpoint fi stored with Ni is used
for doing this. If ∥fi −xj∥< dj, i.e., if Nj is closer to Ni’s footpoint than it is
to its previously computed own footpoint, it is needed to update Nj’s distance and
footpoint information (dj ←∥fi −xj∥and fj ←fi) and add Nj to the priority
queue. This process is repeated until the queue becomes empty.
Due to the use of a priority queue this algorithm requires a central base station.
However, it is possible to approximate this algorithm and make it fully distributed
by cleverly modifying the medium access protocol as will be discussed below.
4.3.3.2 Distributed Distance-to-Contour Flooding
When implementing the fast marching in a network, it is required that each node up-
dates its neighbors by sending its footpoint information. We note that nodes that are
inside the contour are footpoint to themselves, and hence have perfect information
at the start of the algorithm. Inspired by the optimal centralized implementation of
the algorithm, one can see that it is optimal to have nodes with a smaller distance to
the contour update their neighbors ﬁrst. In practical networks, this can be achieved
by giving those nodes a higher probability psend to gain access to the channel. While
nodes are waiting to access the channel, they can accumulate neighbor update events
and only propagate the best footpoint found so far. This probability psend is typically
a function of a backoff timer in practical protocols such as 802.11, or alternatively,
it is a function of the scheduling algorithm carried out at the AP.
The simulations are done with a random backoff timer that determines when
nodes update their neighbors. Assume that CW is the initial backoff range that re-
sults in a low number of packet collisions that can be neglected. A backoff timer
can be used to determine when nodes can access the channel, by choosing a random
number in the backoff range. Since distance-to-contour information is spreading in
the network away from the contour, one wants to make sure that nodes only send
when all nodes in their neighborhood that are closer to the contour have sent ﬁrst.
As illustrated in Fig. 4.5, one can be sure that all black footpoints fi with backoff
in the range [0...CW[ will have sent after time CW, if collisions requiring retrans-
missions are neglected for the ease of reasoning. As a result, a node A that receives
an update from a footpoint f1 (with backoff Bf1 in range [0...CW[) will have to
wait an additional CW −Bf1 after reception of f1’s update. This can be achieved if
A will select a random number in the range [(CW −Bf1)...(CW −Bf1) + CW[.
Clearly, as indicated in Fig. 4.5, the updating speed of the network will be approxi-
mately1 the one-hop communication range h, each CW timeslots.
A distributed implementation of the scheme potentially results in a node spread-
ing information before it obtained its closest footpoint. Such a node will have to

over a distance h each step.

Fig. 4.5 Black nodes (such
as f1 and f2) correspond to
interior nodes (i.e., nodes
inside the contour). The
straight lines trace the regions
which are closest to a certain
interior node (i.e., the Voronoi
regions). The new proposed
backoff scheme ensures that
nodes (such as A and B)
which are closer to the
interior contour nodes are
updated ﬁrst before they
propagate this contour
distance information to the
other nodes. This propagation
can be performed at a cost of
almost N transmissions, the
total number of nodes
update its neighbors more than once. This is illustrated for node C in Fig. 4.5. Node
C receives information of node B only before time 2CW, and hence thinks its clos-
est point on the contour is f2. Following the algorithm, C will have chosen a ran-
dom backoff in the range [(CW −BB)...(CW −BB) + CW[ to start updating its
neighbors. If node C does not receive correct information before that random time,
wrong information will be propagated and node C will have to update his neigh-
bors a second time once information about the correct footpoint f1 is obtained. In
practice, with this scheme, the number of update events is experienced to be very
close to the number of nodes (neglecting collisions) as also illustrated in Table 4.1.
The contour spreading as function of time is illustrated in Fig. 4.6 for a simulated
scenario.
It is important to see that the algorithm will converge for arbitrary complex con-
tour shapes, such as the one shown in Fig. 4.3 which consists of multiple parts.

4.3.4 Iterative Power Control
Given the learned shortest distance to the target contour, the cognitive secondary
user decides conservatively on its transmission power. This initial transmission
power is typically suboptimal and will now be adapted efﬁciently by the following
iterative procedure. Using the contour estimation method proposed in Sect. 4.3.2,
nodes classify themselves as interior or exterior with respect to the secondary
sender’s target interference power contour. If no node inside this contour is within
a target distance of the ﬁrst transmitter’s contour, the secondary transmitter should
increase its power. The amount of power increase will be robustly determined by
locally estimating the pathloss parameters as will be discussed below. Alternatively,
in case the contours overlap, the cognitive sender’s power will have to be decreased.
The number of messages needed to inform the secondary transmitter will be the
number of interior nodes Ninterior, which is smaller than N.2 This power adaptation
is iterated until the distance between the contours is smaller than the one-hop com-
munication distance h. Both scenarios (i.e., power increase and power decrease) are
now discussed in detail.
4.3.4.1 The Increasing Power Scenario
While estimating the second sender’s propagation contour, interior nodes also ro-
bustly approximate the local pathloss parameters ˆαi and ˆβi by minimizing following
weighted least squares objective function:
{ ˆαi, ˆβi} = argmin
α,β

j
wij(α10log10(rj) + β −RSSIj)2,
(4.5)
where rj = ∥xj −xs2∥is the distance from node Nj to the secondary sender and α
is the pathloss exponent and β represents system losses.
The summation is performed over the nodes Nj in the local neighborhood around
Ni, and the weighting is distance-based as given by Eq. 4.3.
Due to this locality, each interior node Ni will ﬁnd a different estimate of those
parameters. However, as mentioned earlier in Fig. 4.3, it is indeed the case that
pathloss can vary signiﬁcantly as function of the exact direction. In the power con-
trol problem, it will be most useful to use the pathloss estimate of the node that will
be closest to the ﬁrst transmitter’s contour.
Interior nodes Ni now send a message to the sender which includes following
information: estimated pathloss parameters ˆαi and ˆβi, footpoint fi on the primary
sender’s contour and distance to this footpoint di = ∥xi −fi∥. The cognitive sec-
ondary sender retains from all these messages the one with minimal di. The cor-
responding node Ni is the interior node (with respect to the secondary sender’s

which is the case in most communication systems that are duplex.

contour) which is closest to the primary contour and hence considered to give the
best estimate of α and β.
The distance d = ∥xs2 −fi∥from the secondary sender xs2 to the footpoint fi
is used together with the estimated pathloss parameters to estimate an improved
transmission power:
P = Pinterference + ˆαi10log10(d) + ˆβi,
(4.6)
where Pinterference denotes the maximal interference that can still be tolerated at the
established contour of the ﬁrst sender.
This process of power adaptation based on the estimated pathloss parameters
at the minimal contour-to-contour node can be iterated to further improve the sec-
ondary transmission power estimation. As can be seen in Fig. 4.7, this requires only
a few iteration steps. In each step, one contour estimation and information propaga-
tion substep needs to be carried out, each with complexity of at most N messages.
4.3.4.2 The Decreasing Power Scenario
When the contours overlap, it will be required that the opportunistic transmitter de-
creases his transmission power. This however is relatively easy, since a node i inside
both contours will have an estimate of the received power from both transmitters,
and can hence easily determine the Pi causing the overlap in contours. A node
noticing such an overlap simply communicates the Pi to the second transmitter,
that follows the largest power adjustment reported. This case is very unlikely to
happen, but since we extrapolate an estimated pathloss model, we cannot avoid the
possibility.
4.3.5 Results
In this section, the simulation setup is introduced and some results discussed.
4.3.5.1 Simulation Model
In order to verify the approach on a data set that is not subject to measurement
errors, it is appropriate to set up a simulation model. The simulation scene consists
of a two-dimensional area in which buildings or obstacles result in shadowing losses
LS, on top of a general pathloss trend that varies with distance:
L = 10α log10(d) + β + LS + Xσ,
(4.7)
where L is the total pathloss in dB (α = 4 and β = 40 dB for the simulations). Since
the measurement data shows a lot of variations in the measured RSSI, even for
a ﬁxed position d and shadowing LS, zero-mean Gaussian distributed variations or

the approximation of the primary signal’s and the secondary transmitter’s interference contour.

point, a new transmission power is computed. Rows B and C show the result of this iterative pro-
cess. Note the large difference between the secondary transmitter’s coverage area at the original
estimate in A and the resulting contour in C
noise Xσ is added. Following the ITU Terrain Model [58] LS is modeled as function
of the depth of the line-of-sight ray into the building. The motivation behind this is
that the wavefront can be modeled as a zone of energy around the line-of-sight.
Diffraction losses occur when part of this zone is obstructed. When the ray just
passes next to the building, half of the zone is obstructed. When the ray passes in

this simulation study, the model is slightly adapted to allow received signals inside
buildings. The exact form of the model is not that important since our technique
should work for any possible situation. The resulting shadowing loss is

tells us how close to the center of
the building the line-of-sight ray crosses. When the line-of-sight ray crosses the
building through the center, we have a maximal LS of 10.25 dB per obstacle which
is a value chosen from [51]. From the center of the building, the shadowing loss
decreases linearly until 0 dB.
4.3.5.2 Results and Discussion
The resulting iterative power adjustment is illustrated for 3 examples in each column
of Fig. 4.7. The primary sender’s contour approximation is drawn using a solid line.
The real contour is drawn as the dashed line. The computed minimal contour-to-
contour distance is indicated by the straight line connecting the two corresponding
nodes. The buildings are drawn as gray boxes. The simulation model as described
above was used, with a noise power of 4 corresponding to the real-world measure-
ments. We used quadratic MLS with a kernel width of 95 m in all examples.
As can be seen in all images, the computed contours approximate the exact ones
very well: Only 0.7% on average of all nodes was misclassiﬁed. Note that these

2D contour curves are in reality not constructed, but nodes locally make a binary
classiﬁcation as being interior or not. The curves are shown only for illustration
purposes.
The images in row A show the secondary contour resulting from the initial power
estimate based on the distance between the secondary sender and the primary con-
tour. An optimistic pathloss model with α = 2 was used for the computation of the
secondary transmitter’s power as function of the measured distance from the ﬁrst
transmitter. Since actual propagation is by deﬁnition worse than the most optimistic
condition, the coverage of the secondary transmitter is typically very small using
this power, as can be seen in Fig. 4.7, row A.
The algorithm however iteratively estimates a more realistic pathloss model for
the secondary transmitter, and as a result achieves a much more realistic power ad-
justment already after one iteration. As can be seen in Fig. 4.7, the resulting coverage
of the secondary transmitter can be increased considerably in each of the 3 scenar-
ios, without causing interference (i.e., overlap of the contours) to the ﬁrst transmit-
ter. Each power adjustment step requires estimation of the secondary transmitter’s
contour at the cost of N transmissions. Next, each node inside the contour requires
propagating its distance to the ﬁrst contour and its estimated pathloss, at the cost
of Ninterior < N transmissions. As can be seen in the ﬁnal images C, a much larger
area is covered by the secondary transmitter as compared to the initial conﬁguration
shown in row A.
The algorithm not only results in improved spatial reuse gain, but also relaxes the
opportunistic transmitters’ sensitivity requirements. Indeed, traditional approaches
would require each possible transmitter to be able to sense the ﬁrst transmitter. For
a given target power of the second transmitter, this results in very high sensitivity
requirements. In this distributed run time approach, these requirements are relaxed,
and the ﬁrst transmitter’s propagation contour is estimated close to the ﬁrst transmit-
ter and then efﬁciently propagated. Both this estimation and propagation are cheap
and require only N transmissions. Typically, the algorithm converges in two to three
iterations.
Due to the approximative inside/outside classiﬁcation, we can not guarantee that
the real ﬁnal contours do not overlap and little interference might occur. As can
be seen on the images, only in example 2 the ﬁnal contours overlap, though for a
negligible amount. However, it would be interesting future research to quantify the
amount of possible overlap.
4.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, focus was on the monitoring challenge for smart opportunistic ra-
dios. A new approach for iterative power control where to goal is to maximize
spatial reuse while avoiding unwanted interference to existing networks was pro-
posed. First, the propagation contours of the existing networks are estimated and
efﬁciently propagated. Next, the secondary transmitter’s power control is iteratively

adapted based on estimates of real pathloss conditions. This is done by calibrat-
ing a design time model by means of run time monitored information. No explicit
feedback from the primary system can be assumed in this case. The main concepts
behind the design of the scheme were motivated from outdoor measurements. The
resulting scheme is shown to result in a much improved spatial reuse compared to
traditional approaches. By instantiating the framework, leveraging on concepts such
as design time modeling and run time calibration and monitoring, it is possible to
avoid interference while optimizing spatial reuse.

Chapter 5
Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater
than the Sum of Its Parts
5.1 Introduction
We have argued in Chap. 3 that RT solutions based purely on DT models are inef-
fective. In a complex environment solutions need to be learned at RT. In this chapter,
we build further on this observation. We focus on the horizontal sharing of two stan-
dards that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band: IEEE 802.11g Wireless LAN [59] and
IEEE 802.15.4 Sensor Networks [60], illustrated in Fig. 5.1. As mentioned in the
previous chapter, in the ISM bands wireless spectrum sharing is the most ﬂexible
and, hence, the most difﬁcult to control. Though the IEEE 802.11 is the most pop-
ular standard and intra-coexistence is important (also see Chap. 7), the ISM bands
are horizontally shared by many other devices like IEEE 802.15.4 sensor terminals.
From Fig. 5.1 we can see that, while these two standards have equal rights to the
spectrum, the characteristics of both standards are very different and the problem
turns out to be asymmetric in nature.
Indeed, the output power of IEEE 802.15.4 devices is usually as low as 0 dBm
[61], while the output power of IEEE 802.11g devices is typically above 15 dBm
[62]. Also, IEEE 802.15.4 sensor networks are designed to monitor the environ-
ment or buildings, and are typically very large. IEEE 802.11 networks are typically
hotspots centered around an Access Point (AP), and hence more local. Finally, sen-
sor network applications are not demanding in terms of throughput, but however
require a high reliability and robustness against attacks or unknown events. They
should also be self-organizing since it is impossible to maintain such large net-
works manually. IEEE 802.11 networks are typically used by a limited number of
throughput-intensive applications.
Although recent studies have shown that sensor networks do have an impact on
IEEE 802.11 networks [63], it is well accepted that coexistence of both networks af-
fects the sensor networks most [64]. In this chapter, we design distributed protocols
for IEEE 802.15.4 networks to optimize their performance under varying interfer-
ence. The proposed algorithms should be distributed in order to improve scalability,
robustness and adaptability. More speciﬁcally, we design distributed channel selec-
tion algorithms that allow the sensor terminals to dynamically adapt their channel

Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
Fig. 5.1 IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 both operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This leads to
coexistence issues, most prominently at the side of the ZigBee network
selection to the observed interference patterns. Importantly, the algorithms are eval-
uated for coexistence with IEEE 802.11 systems. However, they are designed to be
so ﬂexible that they can adapt to any interference pattern, as long as the coherence
time of the interference is longer than one IEEE 802.15.4 period.
This chapter is structured as follows. First, we explain the system model in
Sect. 5.2. The benchmark solution for this chapter is presented in Sect. 5.3. In
Sect. 5.4, we describe the problem statement and how we can reformulate the prob-
lem for practical use. We also detail the downsides to the problem reformulation.
In Sect. 5.6, we design learning-based algorithms, that eliminate the scanning over-
head. In Sect. 5.7, we show that these energy-efﬁcient learning-based algorithms
outperform the scanning-based approaches. Finally, in Sect. 5.8, we present out con-
cluding remarks.
5.2 Modeling Coexistence
In this section we give a short overview of the models used for the sensor network,
the WLAN interference, and the considered energy and performance metrics that
are relevant for the considered scenario. For a more detailed overview of the as-
sumptions made and the implementation details, we refer to [19, 65].
5.2.1 IEEE 802.15.4 Network Model
Sensor networks typically consist of a large number of terminals, e.g., to monitor the
environment or for building automation. As a result, we represent the IEEE 802.15.4
network by a large number of terminals n that are arranged in a string. The con-
nectivity matrix C(n,n) denotes which sensors can overhear which others. We as-
sume that all sensors in the range Rd can overhear each other’s beacons, where d
is the inter-terminal distance. In Fig. 5.2 a simple string topology is presented with

5.2
Modeling Coexistence
75
Fig. 5.2 The considered scenario is a string topology of IEEE 802.15.4 terminals, where terminals
report to a sink that is placed at one side of the string. Interference is generated by WLAN devices
and is dynamic in both time and space
R = 2. Each of the sensor terminals is currently operating in one of the F possible
channels. As explained above, F = 16 for IEEE 802.15.4 networks operating in the
2.4 GHz ISM band. An n-dimensional vector tn keeps track of the current frequency
fi (i ∈[1,...,F]), which the different terminals are using to transmit. Every termi-
nal transmits its beacon at this frequency, according to the beacon-enabled mode.
We assume that the sensors potentially swap frequency every inter-beacon period,
which ranges from 15 ms to above 4 min according to the standard. When and how
to swap will be determined by the distributed adaptation algorithms.
5.2.2 IEEE 802.11 Interference Model
We consider a large IEEE 802.15.4 network, that is affected by IEEE 802.11 in-
terference. This IEEE 802.11 interference is assumed to vary over time, space and
frequency.
The variations in frequency result from the fact that different IEEE 802.11 net-
works can operate simultaneously using a different channel. Dynamic Frequency
Selection (DFS) is a new functionality currently added to most of those IEEE 802.11
networks and Access Points. It is developed to optimize the frequency alloca-
tion of IEEE 802.11 networks that are subject to interference, which can be self-
interference or interference resulting from other networks or devices. As a result of
this adaptive and hence dynamic frequency selection, IEEE 802.11 networks are not
operating at ﬁxed channels over time.
It can be seen in Fig. 5.1, that each IEEE 802.11 network always covers four
consecutive channels of IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The power distribution over the
channel is more or less ﬂat, especially for the OFDM-based IEEE 802.11g net-
works [59].

76
5
Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
The variation in time results from the fact that the activity of the IEEE 802.11
networks is dependent on the time-varying demand of its users [66]. From this study
it can also be reasonably assumed that the IEEE 802.11 interference stays constant
over several (thousands) of IEEE 802.15.4 inter-beacon periods.
The spatial variations result from the IEEE 802.15.4 deployment, which usu-
ally covers a very large area (e.g., for monitoring purposes). As a result, the
IEEE 802.15.4 networks are expected to be large both in terms of the area they cover
and the number of terminals they consist of. The theoretical transmission, and hence
also interference, range of IEEE 802.11 networks is 100 m to even 250 m. Although
this is a signiﬁcant range, sensor networks can cover larger areas since they consist
of a large number of terminals in a mesh topology. As a result, the IEEE 802.11
interference is assumed to affect large geographical subsets of the IEEE 802.15.4
network of terminals (Fig. 5.2).
As a last step, we assume that an active or interfering IEEE 802.11 network will
always be detected by the IEEE 802.15.4 terminals [65].
The IEEE 802.11 interference can thus ﬁnally be modeled as a matrix I(n,F).
Each interfering network then corresponds to a submatrix of dimensions (ni,4),
where ni denotes the number of terminals that are interfered by network i (depend-
ing on its output power), and where it is taken into account that every IEEE 802.11
interference pattern has a width of four IEEE 802.15.4 channels. Networks can swap
frequency over time, disappear or appear, but this time variation is assumed to be
slow compared to the IEEE 802.15.4 frequency adaptation.
5.2.3 Performance and Energy Measures
We consider delay as a relevant performance metric (throughput requirements in
sensor networks are typically low). More precisely, assuming that sensors monitor a
variable that should be communicated to a central sink, we consider the number of
periods required to forward a measurement to a ﬁxed central sink. This average is
computed over time and over the terminals in the network. The more the network is
affected by the interference, the more periods are required on average to reach the
sink. We assume that every packet is forwarded during each period, to the terminal
closest to the sink that can be reached in that period. As a result, packets travel each
period the largest possible distance.
For the energy cost, we can model the energy needed during every period inde-
pendently of the actual packets sent, received or beacons overheard. This is a valid
assumption as throughput in sensor network applications is typically very low, and,
moreover, the transmit power, PTx, is lower than the receive power, PRx [30]. Since
the full receive chain is required to be on for scanning, the power consumption in
that mode is the same as the power cost in the receive mode! During every super-
frame, each terminal is awake to listen at least to its current frequency channel.
The quality of a frequency channel can be assessed by counting the overheard bea-
cons of neighbors. If no beacons are heard, energy detection, which is part of the

5.3
Basic Solution: Random Frequency Selection
77
IEEE 802.15.4 speciﬁcations, can be used to detect interference on the channel. As
a result, the energy consumption can be modeled as only varying with the number
of channels that are scanned (or listened to) in parallel:
Etot = nstaPRx,
(5.1)
where ns is the number of channels scanned and ta is the active period per super-
frame.
In sensor networks, switching energy also presents a large portion of the con-
sumed energy. As we explain in Sect. 5.4, we redeﬁne the problem statement. The
goal of the current chapter is to have all terminals on the same channel, so switching
isn’t necessary anymore. This way, a terminal that performs well in the redeﬁned
problem, also minimizes switching energy.
5.3 Basic Solution: Random Frequency Selection
The simplest DFS algorithm is a scheme where nodes randomly (uniform distri-
bution) pick a channel every period. It can of course be expected that the average
delay in this Random Frequency Selection (RFS) scheme will be large. However,
since it does not rely on any coordination between the nodes and does not rely on
an environment model, it is very robust.
5.4 The Problem from a Different Angle
In the current chapter, our goal is to minimize the average packet delay to the sink.
This target function is unfortunately quite difﬁcult to model, so we will approximate
it by inspecting the optimal solution. In any learning system, deﬁning a target func-
tion, which can be measured at RT, is a vital step in the solution design (see [67,
Chap. I]).
As mentioned in Sect. 5.2, we assumed the sensor network to have a low duty
cycle. Under this assumption a packet has the least delay if it can travel the fur-
thest distance each hop. Obviously, the optimal solution is then the one where all
terminals share a common channel. In that case, we can ensure that each packet,
independently of where it was generated, can travel the furthest distance and have
an efﬁcient last hop.
We can now come up with a simple approximation of our target function: we
no longer look at the delay, but try to get all the terminals on the same channel.
Clearly, any solution presented in this chapter can thus also be used to dynamically
and distributed ﬁnd a common control channel (CCC), which is of high importance
for Opportunistic Radio networks [68, 69].

Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
5.5 Scan-Based Approaches
In [19, 65, 70], we have shown that it is possible to outperform RFS, since the con-
sidered IEEE 802.11 interference does not vary every IEEE 802.15.4 period. Here,
we explain how scan-based approaches relying on techniques similar to simulated
annealing, can be elegantly implemented in the considered network setup.
In Sect. 7.3.5, we use simulated annealing can be applied to the distributed op-
timization of IEEE 802.11 networks. In this section, we use a similar technique,
that only considers the potential energy as a variable. Hence, we don’t anneal. In
Sect. 5.6.3.2, we explain in detail why it is very difﬁcult to anneal in this context.
When optimizing the frequency allocation over a large sensor network affected
by dynamic interference, terminals need to keep looking for another channel. Every
period, next to its current frequency channel, fi, terminal i scans ns other channels
(grouped in Si) and assesses their performance. This is done according to a reward
function Rw.
We use the following deﬁnition of Rw(f ) as an approximation of the real target
function (also see Sect. 5.4):
Rw(f ) =
(beacons heard) + 1
when no interference detected,

when interference is detected.
(5.2)
When IEEE 802.11 interference is present, the reward for using that channel is equal
to zero (worst-case). When no IEEE 802.11 interference is present, the reward func-
tion is assumed to be proportional to the number of heard beacons, augmented by
one to distinguish from the worst-case.
In simulated annealing, exploration is embedded in the algorithm to allow the
system to jump out of a local optimum. This means that a scanned channel can be
accepted even if it is measured to be worse than the current channel according to
the observed reward. Usually, this happens with a certain probability that should be
decreased each time interval to eventually converge to the optimal solution.
The group of candidates for possible selection, Ci is deﬁned as follows:
Ci = (fi ∪Si)\Ii,
(5.3)
where fi is the current channel, Si is the group of scanned channels and Ii are the
channels where terminal i detected interference. The probability to select a channel,
f , from the group of candidates is then equal to:
p(f ) =
e
Rw(f )
T

∀f ∈Ci e
Rw(f )

f ∈Ci,
(5.4)
where T is a constant temperature.
As far as energy is concerned, the proposed algorithm requires to scan the current
channel and ns. Scanning cost is, hence, multiplied with a factor ns as compared to
RFS, where only the current channel is scanned.

Fig. 5.3 The framework of the dynamic frequency selection algorithms relies on feedback from
the environment. The performance increase of the learning engine allows to decrease the quality
of the feedback (no out-of-band scanning), while maintaining similar performance (see Sect. 5.7)
5.6 Distributed Learning and Exploration
In this section, we explain how we can design scanless approaches, using the generic
framework, presented in Chap. 3. The goal of these scanless approaches is to reach
similar or better performance as those presented in Sect. 5.5, while removing the
extra hardware complexity and energy cost. Rather than extensively monitor the
scenario, which requires scanning overhead, in this section we learn at RT. As men-
tioned in Chap. 3, this is a vital element of Cognitive Spectrum Access.
5.6.1 General Framework
In this section, we give an overview of the proposed algorithm and how it relates
to the generic framework, presented in Chap. 3. In Fig. 5.3 the framework of the
entire control algorithm is shown. The DT procedure used is simple RFS, presented
in Sect. 5.3. From this DT procedure, a RT procedure is learned through interac-
tion with the environment. The framework relies heavily on the feedback from the
environment. The number of observed neighbors is used to learn an optimal conﬁg-
uration. In this case study chapter, we have selected a simple AR-ﬁlter as learning
engine. This is further detailed in Sect. 5.6.2.
The exploration algorithm is discussed in Sect. 5.6.3. We have already mentioned
earlier that it is very difﬁcult to anneal in the current context. This is further ex-
plained in Sect. 5.6.3.2. In Sect. 5.6.3.3, we explain how a scenario-based approach
can overcome the obstacles faced when annealing. The considered scenarios are

boundary detection and appearance of IEEE 802.11 interference. For both scenar-
ios, the heuristic recommendations increase the exploration rate of the engine.
5.6.2 Learning Engine
In this chapter, we consider a simple Auto Regressive (AR)-ﬁlter. Contrary to Q-
learning (see Chap. 7 and [67]), the AR-ﬁlter maintains a one-dimensional table
rather than a two-dimensional one. This has no impact on the performance in the
current context as the reward function is independent of the current state of the
terminal.
Our goal in this section is to learn the reward of selecting a certain channel. To
do so, we estimate the reward function, Rw(f ), presented in Sect. 5.5. This is done
by updating its current estimate using the following rule:

R(k+1)
w
(f ) = (1 −α)
R(k)
w (f ) + αRw(f ),
(5.5)
where 
R(k)
w (f ) is the estimate of the reward function at frequency f at interval k,
α is the learning parameter and Rw(f ) is the current evaluation of the reward func-
tion.
It is important to note that the AR-ﬁlter updates the estimates, but in fact does
not specify what actions should be taken. Instead of greedily optimizing this re-
ward function, arbitrary experimentation is allowed. This is an important property
in a time varying environment and allows decoupling the learning phase from the
decision policy.
5.6.3 Exploration Algorithms
The algorithms presented in Sect. 5.5 suffer from hardware complexity and extra
energy cost due to out-of-band scanning. In this section, out-of-band scanning is
not performed any longer. Hence, the candidate set, Ci, covers all IEEE 802.15.4
channels. Differentiation between the channels is based on the observed history,
rather than instantaneous observations.
The algorithms presented in Sect. 5.5 also suffer from over-exploration when
steady-state has reached, as no cooling scheme is deﬁned. As mentioned above, the
goal of simulated annealing is to balance exploitation and exploration by deﬁning a
cooling scheme to deﬁne the value and evolution of T in Eq. 5.4. When T is high, the
channel is selected randomly. However, as we lower T according to some cooling
scheme, exploration is reduced and eventually we converge to a greedy selection.
This means that the DT procedure used in this chapter is the simple RFS.
However, we show in Sect. 5.6.3.2, why a blind learner will perform very subop-
timally in the present context and how the framework presented in Chap. 3 can be
used to overcome this problem. Hence, in the present context DT knowledge is not

Fig. 5.4 Local optima cause
very large delays. Cooling
down in a local optimum
causes a disjunction between
two sets of terminals that
have converged on different
channels. Any packet
generated on the left-hand
side will never reach the sink
used to increase convergence speed or performance while converging. It is used to
increase the performance of the steady-state result.
As in Sect. 5.5, we ﬁrst consider a reward-based exploration instantiation of sim-
ulated annealing. In Sect. 5.6.3.2, we then explain the obstacles faced when design-
ing a cooling scheme. Section 5.6.3.3 then explains how we have overcome these
obstacles using a scenario-based framework, as the one presented in Chap. 3.
5.6.3.1 Reward-Based (RB) Exploration
In this section, the temperature, T , is kept constant and we do not deﬁne a cooling
scheme. Hence, the rate of exploration is only altered through the reward, 
R(k)
w . If
the reward of the current state is high, less exploration is allowed. However, since no
cooling scheme is deﬁned, we will never eliminate exploring and terminals can still
jump out of the optimal solution once in a while. We have observed that this effect
actually can strongly reduce the efﬁciency (delay) in the steady-state. It is therefore
necessary to ﬁnd a cooling scheme.
5.6.3.2 Finding a Cooling Scheme
Finding a proper cooling scheme is a difﬁcult task. If we just anneal and gradually
drop the temperature to 0 K, we risk getting stuck in local optimum or are not able
to adapt to the time-varying IEEE 802.11 interference. In many problems a trade-
off is made between the speed of convergence and attaining the global optimum.
However, the local optima of our derived problem are extremely suboptimal in the
original problem statement (see Sect. 5.4)!
In Fig. 5.4 we illustrate this: a local optimum for the approximated goal destroys
every opportunity to get the packet to the sink. Though exploring terminals might
be able to bridge the packet over the boundary, a system that has been cooled down
cannot (as no exploration is anymore allowed). Therefore reaching an optimal so-
lution can not be traded off with convergence speed. This makes the selection of a
proper cooling scheme (if there is any at all) very difﬁcult and we have to make for
each scenario a very wise choice of all parameters involved. Even then, it can still
happen that we get stuck in a local optimum. In the next section, we will discuss how
we can use the framework presented in Chap. 3 to design a more robust algorithm.

Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
5.6.3.3 Adaptive Simulated Annealing
The high-level idea of our approach is similar to Adaptive Simulated Annealing
(ASA). As discussed, removing exploration increases the chance of being stuck in a
local optimum. Furthermore, it removes the ability of the framework to respond to
dynamism.
However, a ﬁrst scenario that we consider is the appearance of IEEE 802.11
interference on the current channel. When such interference is detected, the explo-
ration is reinitialized, i.e., we reinitialize the temperature. As communication is no
longer possible under IEEE 802.11 interference, this can be easily detected. Further-
more, when the environment suddenly changes, e.g., lots of neighbors disappear,
one should also re-initialize the temperature. This allows the framework to perform
optimally, while still being able to respond to the environment dynamism.
As mentioned in Sect. 5.6.3.2, we also need to protect the network against local
optima. Our approach is rather similar to what we described above. Again, we try
to detect if we are in a local optimum and increase exploration rate around the
boundary. Hence, we see convergence centers created at the boundaries that ripple
through the entire network chain. It is only when the different converged regions
will agree on the channel that exploration is completely given up.
The detection algorithm now is not so easy anymore as in the interference case.
As mentioned above, we have to rely on routing information. As it is known to the
terminals whether other terminals are further or closer to the sink (in the routing
table), we can use this information to detect boundaries. At a boundary a terminal
will see a lot of terminals either closer to the sink or farther from the sink. If a
boundary is detected, the boundary algorithm is initialized. It should be noted that
the detection algorithm is only executed when the terminals have cooled down (after
they have spent more than x iterations on a temperature lower than Tc). Otherwise,
this detection algorithm would make a decision too quickly. This would interfere
with the AR algorithm and can cause non-convergence.
We will now detail the boundary algorithm. The boundary terminals re-initialize
the temperature, going for heavy exploration. Furthermore, boundary terminals are
not allowed to re-enter the previous channel for some time. The boundary algorithm
is hence a complete exploration phase. There are two possibilities:
• One side of the boundary has been quicker to converge. They will detect the
boundary sooner and begin exploration. As a result, they will go looking for the
terminals on the other side of the boundary. If they ﬁnd the other terminals, new
boundary terminals are formed in the quicker converged center. These terminals
will then go to the same channel as the previous terminals and, hence, one side of
the boundary adopts the channel of the other (1-sided ripple).
• Both sides of the boundary detect the boundary at almost the same time. The
boundary terminals will converge on a third channel. At both sides new boundary
terminals are formed and the new channel is rippled through both convergence
centers (2-sided ripple).

Simulation Results
83
Fig. 5.5 These are instantaneous delays for different size networks. All 16 ZigBee channels are
assumed to be available. Simulation procedure is the following: we allow the algorithms to reach
a certain point. At that point, a packet is generated in the network. The instantaneous delay is then
the delay of this packet. In these ﬁgures, the delays are averaged over 400 packets per run and 100
runs are executed
5.7 Simulation Results
In this section, we present some simulation results. In Fig. 5.5 the instantaneous
delay for different situations is shown. Here, all 16 channels are assumed to be
free of IEEE 802.11 interference. It can be clearly seen that the ASA algorithm
outperforms the RB algorithm. Not only does it reach an optimal steady state (no
exploration and all nodes on the same channel), it also converges signiﬁcantly faster.

Coexistence: The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts
Fig. 5.6 Normalized delay increase compared to ideal channel allocation
However, we can see some spikes in Fig. 5.5. This is due to the local optima as dis-
cussed in Sect. 5.6.3.2. Initially, some neighboring nodes settle quickly on a channel
but enough nodes remain exploring to bridge possible boundaries. Later on, these
bridging nodes settle down and the algorithm gets stuck in a local optimum. As de-
scribed in Sect. 5.6.3.3, the local optimum is detected and new convergence centers
are rippled through the network. This increases the range of the converged areas,
while eventually all nodes will settle down on one channel. Obviously, the bigger
the network size, the slower the convergence.
For reference, we also present the results from a scenario presented in [65]. In
Fig. 5.6 we can clearly see that the ASA algorithm reaches an almost optimal solu-
tion, i.e. a normalized delay of 1, even in the presence of a dynamic IEEE 802.11
interference. The results are even better than might be expected from Fig. 5.5. This
is due to the dynamics of the IEEE 802.11 interference. As the interference is easily
detected and degrades all communication, the IEEE 802.11 interference effectively
reduces the available channels from 16 to 8. The presence of less available channels
increases convergence speed. In the case that only one channel would be free for
all nodes, any interference-aware algorithm will converge almost directly on that
channel.

rithms for IEEE 802.15.4 networks in the presence of dynamic IEEE 802.11 inter-

ference. The objective in this chapter was to minimize the end-to-end delay from
packets generated randomly in a large network to a sink.
First, we restated the problem by inspecting the optimal solution under low-
throughput assumption. We have shown that in the optimal solution all nodes use
the same channel. Hence, we have redeﬁned our goal function from minimizing
delay to getting all the terminals on the same channel.
We have proposed both scan-based approaches that use instantaneous informa-
tion and scanless-based approaches that learn the environment through past obser-
vations. These algorithms improve over those presented in [65] by letting the nodes
settle down and freeze in a certain state. Due to the reformed problem statement, we
have shown that this is only possible using an adaptive scenario-based framework,
as presented in Chap. 3.
Simulation results have shown that all algorithms are able to react to the dynamic
nature of the IEEE 802.11 interference. However, detailed delay analysis has proven
that our scanless approach outperforms the scan-based proposals, while also having
a lower hardware complexity and energy cost.
Due to the reformed problem statement, the developed algorithms are naturally
suited to ﬁnd a Common Control Channel (CCC) for an OSA network.

Anticipative Energy and QoS Management:
Systematically Improving the User Experience
6.1 Energy Efﬁciency for Smart Radios
6.1.1 Minimum Energy at Sufﬁcient QoS
While the need for ﬂexibility and intelligent control is well studied in the context
of smart or cognitive radios for the sake of spectrum efﬁciency, it can used for op-
timizing the usage of other scarce resources such as energy. The design framework
for smart radios of Chap. 3 is instantiated here to achieve smart, energy efﬁcient
software radios. More speciﬁcally, it is shown how it can be used to achieve smart,
energy efﬁcient IEEE 802.11a devices, provided their hardware is designed to be
energy scalable. An energy scalable radio can be reconﬁgured or tuned at run-time
in a way that energy consumption is impacted, so such a radio can beneﬁt from
a smart control strategy to save energy. Of course, this energy saving should not
come at the expense of the user experience, so the objective of the smart control in
this chapter is: how to adapt the radio so that the application performance is met at
minimal possible energy consumption.
The focus of this chapter is on wireless networks where all users are in the
same collision domain with an access point (AP) to arbitrate exclusive channel ac-
cess (Fig. 6.2). An uplink real-time video streaming application is considered. The
challenge in energy management for these systems is to determine how the sys-
tem should sleep or scale and still meet per-packet QoS timing requirements. The
instantiation takes advantage of the fact that the system will operate in dynamic en-
vironments where a single energy management solution is not sufﬁcient. The main
dynamics are encountered in the channel state and application load requirements.
Furthermore, in a network of such systems, an efﬁcient energy management algo-
rithm should exploit the variations across users to minimize the overall network
energy consumption.
Therefore the problem explored here could be stated as follows: How does one
decide what system conﬁgurations to assign to each user at run-time to minimize
the overall energy consumption while providing a sufﬁcient level of QoS? This must

be achieved for a network of users with bursty delay-sensitive data and over a slow
fading channel.
We brieﬂy recapitulate the following three observations that show that the pro-
posed adaptation problem is not trivial and requires to streamline energy manage-
ment approaches across layers.
• First, state-of-the-art wireless systems such as 802.11a devices are built to func-
tion at a ﬁxed set of operating points assuming worst-case conditions. Irrespective
of the link utilization, the highest feasible transmission rate is used and the power
ampliﬁer operates at maximum output power [21]. For non-scalable systems, the
highest rate results in the smallest duty cycle and hence the lowest energy con-
sumption. On the other hand, for scalable systems, this strategy results in ex-
cessive energy consumption for average channel conditions and link utilizations.
Recent energy-efﬁcient wireless system designs focus on VLSI implementations
and adaptive physical layer algorithms where a lower transmission rate results in
energy savings per bit [38, 71]. For these schemes to be practical, they should be
aware of the hardware energy characteristics at various operating points.
• Second, to realize signiﬁcant energy savings, systems need to shutdown the com-
ponents when inactive. This is achieved only by tightly coupling the MAC com-
munication to the power management strategy in order to communicate trafﬁc
requirements of each user for scheduling shutdown intervals.
• Finally, intrinsic trade-offs exist between schemes while satisfying the timeliness
requirements across multiple users. As the channel is shared, lowering the rate of
one user reduces the time left for the other delay-sensitive users. This forces them
to increase their rate, at the cost of energy consumption or bit errors.
Our approach couples these tasks in a systematic manner to determine the optimal
system-wide power management at run-time.
6.1.2 Smart Aspects and Energy Efﬁciency
We propose a two-phase run-time/design-time solution to efﬁciently solve the sleep-
scaling trade-off across the physical, link and MAC layers for multiple users. It is
an instantiation of the abstract design ﬂow discussed in Chap. 3. At design-time the
problem is resolved by searching for a set of close-to-optimal points in the solution
space. This anticipates a set of possibly good system conﬁgurations. Starting from
this conﬁguration space, we can schedule the nodes at run-time to achieve near-
optimal energy consumption with low overhead. The ﬂow is illustrated in Fig. 6.1.
It is clear that the set of possible points is fully characterized at design time. At run
time, as function of the monitored scenario, the most energy efﬁcient conﬁguration
can then be selected. In the next section, the design approach is detailed further.
The research in this chapter has been performed in close collaboration with Rahul
Mangharam at Carnegie Mellon University. This cooperation also leads to several
shared papers [72–75].

downlink communication
6.2 Anticipation Through Design Time Modeling
In this section, we follow the design steps considered in the design ﬂow proposed
in Chap. 3 to achieve the required performance at minimal QoS for the cognitive
radios. Consider a wireless network as in Fig. 6.2 where multiple nodes are cen-
trally controlled by an AP. Each node (such as a handheld video camera) desires
to transmit or receive frames in real-time and it is the AP’s responsibility to assign
channel-access grants. The resource allocation scheme within the AP speciﬁes each
user’s system conﬁguration settings for the next transmission based on the feedback
of the system state from the current transmission. It must ensure that the nodes meet
their performance constraints by delivering their data in a timely manner while con-
suming minimal energy. The problem is ﬁrst stated formally and a speciﬁc example
is provided further in this chapter. The network consists of n ﬂows {F1,F2,...,Fn}
with periodic delay-sensitive frames or jobs. For notational simplicity, we assume
a one-to-one mapping of ﬂows to nodes, but the method is also applicable to more
ﬂows per node.
The design time steps, the focus of this chapter, are discussed in the next subsec-
tions. First, it is required to deﬁne the control dimensions or the available ﬂexibility.
Next, the system scenarios need to be determined or what scenarios the cognitive
radio is expected to encounter. Then, the relevant cost, resource and quality dimen-
sions need to be deﬁned. They deﬁne what the cognitive radio should adapt for.

These cost, quality and resource dimensions can be layered, to facilitate run-time
information ﬂow and ease of modeling. Finally, the mapping of the control dimen-
sions impact on cost, quality and resource needs to be determined, for each of the
system state scenarios. This means that for each possible scenario that the cogni-
tive radio would encounter, it should be determined what the impact of a certain
control know conﬁguration would be on the cost, quality or resource dimensions.
After these four design-time phases, the run-time phase can be carried out, as will
be explained in Sect. 6.3.2.
6.2.1 Flexibility for Energy and QoS
Control Dimensions or Knobs (Ki,j): For the considered 802.11a transceiver, we
identify several control dimensions that trade-off performance for energy savings.
Our system modeling is based on an 802.11a [76] direct conversion transceiver im-
plementation with turbo coding [77] (Fig. 6.3). Four control dimensions have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on energy and performance for these OFDM transceivers: the mod-
ulation order (NMod), the code rate (Bc), the power ampliﬁer transmit power (PTx)
and its linearity speciﬁed by the back-off (b).
For the energy modeling, we focus on the power ampliﬁer control knob as PA’s
generally are the most power-hungry component in the transmitter consuming up-
wards of 600 mW [78]. The major drawback for 802.11a OFDM modulation is the
large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal.1 A high PAPR
renders the implementation costly and inefﬁcient since power-efﬁcient PA designs
require a reduced signal dynamic range [80]. However, reducing the PA’s linear
power ampliﬁcation range clips the transmitted signal and increases the signal dis-
tortion.
To combat this, new PA designs allow to adapt the gain compression character-
istic independently of the output power. Adapting the PA gain compression charac-
teristic allows to translate a transmit power or linearity reduction into an effective
1We note that digital techniques such as clipping also enable to signiﬁcantly decrease the PAPR
constraint [79].

6.2
Anticipation Through Design Time Modeling
91
Fig. 6.4 Adapting the PA gain compression characteristic allows to translate a transmit power or
linearity reduction into an effective energy consumption gain
energy consumption gain. A back-off, b, can be used to steer the linearity of the
ampliﬁcation system versus the energy efﬁciency of the PA [21]. The back-off is de-
ﬁned as the ratio of the effective PA output power to the saturation output power cor-
responding to the 1 dB gain compression point (Fig. 6.4(b)). The saturation power
and hence signal distortion for class A ampliﬁers (used with OFDM) are controlled
by modifying the bias current of the ampliﬁer, which directly inﬂuences its energy
consumption (Fig. 6.4(a)). Since the linearity of the PA determines the distortion
added to the signal, we can write the performance loss due to the PA as function of
b: Di(b). Consequently, we save energy from the increased PA efﬁciency, provided
we ensure that the received signal to noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) is above
the required sensitivity and do not need to retransmit the packet. For the system to
be practical only discrete settings of the control dimensions are considered (listed in
Table 6.1).
We further consider the eight PHY rates supported by 802.11a based on four
modulation and three code rates (Table 2.2). Given the above introduced NMod and
Bc, the bitrate (Bbit) achieved for each modulation-coding pair with Nc OFDM car-
riers and symbol rate B is given by:
Bbit = Nc × NMod × Bc × B.
(6.1)

92

Anticipative Energy and QoS Management
Based on the bitrate, communication performance is determined by the Bit Error
Rate (BER) at the receiver. When transmitter non-linearity is considered, the BER
is expressed as a function of the above introduced SINAD. The SINAD is written
as a function of the power ampliﬁer back-off, given output power PTx and time and
frequency varying channel attenuation A(t,f ) as:
SINAD =
PTx × A(t,f )
A(t,f ) × Di(b) + kT × W × Nf
,
(6.2)
PPA =
PTx
ηPA(b),
(6.3)
where the constants k, T , W and Nf are the Boltzmann constant, working temper-
ature, channel bandwidth and noise ﬁgure of the receiver respectively. The relation
between the power ampliﬁer back-off b and the distortion has been characterized
empirically for the Microsemi LX5506 [81] 802.11a PA in Fig. 6.4. The effective
PA power consumption (PPA) can be expressed as the ratio of the transmit power
(PTx) to the PA efﬁciency (ηPA) that is related to b by an empirical law ﬁtted on
measurements (Eq. 6.3).
Next, at MAC layer, we can add the number of retransmissions as control knob.
These knobs are practical and sufﬁcient to illustrate the potential of the proposed
methods.
6.2.2 The Varying Context
System State (Si,m): In a wireless environment, with e.g. VBR video trafﬁc, the sys-
tem state scenarios used in this design case are the current channel state and appli-
cation frame size. We study the impact of both constant bitrate (CBR) and variable
bitrate (VBR) trafﬁc. For VBR trafﬁc we employ MPEG-4 encoded video traces [82,
83] with peak-to-mean frame sizes ranging from 3 to 20. All fragmentation is done
at the link layer and we use UDP over IP. As the maximum frame size is assumed to
be within the practical limit of 50 fragments, we construct Cost-Resource-Quality
curves for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 fragments/frame and interpolate for inter-
mediate values. The application layer frame size is translated to lower layer Queue
Size and fragment size to facilitate state monitoring and calibration. As a result, no
additional measurements are needed to model trafﬁc requirements, which can be
fully captured in the mapping.
The indoor wireless channel suffers from frequency-selective fading that is time-
varying due to movements of the users or obstacles in its environment. This varying
fading results in varying PER as function of the current transceiver settings. We
use a frequency selective and time varying channel model to compute this PER for
all transceiver settings. An indoor channel model based on HIPERLAN/2 [84] was
used for a terminal moving uniformly at speeds between 0 to 5.2 km/h (walking
speed). Experiments for indoor environments [83] have found the Doppler spread to
be approximately 6 Hz at 5.25 GHz center frequency and 3 Hz at the 2.4 GHz center

frequency. This corresponds to a coherence time of 166 ms for 802.11a networks.
A set of 1000 channel frequency response realizations (sampled every 2 ms over
one minute) were generated and normalized in power. Data was encoded using a
turbo coder model [77] and the bit stream was modulated using 802.11a OFDM
speciﬁcations. For a given back-off b and transmit power PTx, the SINAD at the
receiver antenna was computed for the channel realization A(t,f ) by Eq. 6.2.
We assume an average path-loss A of 80 dB at a distance of 10 m, which consists
both of the transmit antenna gain Gt, receive antenna gain Gr and the propagation
loss. This path-loss is from an empirical model developed at IMEC (Fig. 6.5). It
is representative for indoor channels and results in pathlosses in between the Free
space model and Two ray ground model, which is commonly used for outdoor ap-
plications.
From the channel realization database, a one-to-one mapping of SINAD to re-
ceive block error rate was determined for each modulation and code rate. The chan-
nel is then classiﬁed into 8 classes, determined by a 2 dB difference in the receive
SINAD that is measured for a turbo code BlER of 10−3 (Fig. 6.6(a)). We use a simi-
lar 2 dB discrete step for the PA knobs (Table 6.1). In order to derive a time-varying
link-layer error model, we associate each channel class to a Markov state, each with
a probability of occurrence based on the channel realizations database (Fig. 6.6(b)).
Given this eight-state error model, we are able to model the PER, expressing the
performance per MAC layer packet Lfrag, for different conﬁgurations. The PER is
obtained in Eq. 6.4 by assuming the block errors are uncorrelated for a packet size
of Lfrag bits and a block size of 288 bits:
Pe =

1 −(1 −BlER)
Lfrag
288

(6.4)
This calibration is not a fundamentally new characterization of the hardware.
This BlER-SINAD information just has to be combined with a set of channel states
that are extracted on-line. The combination of this run-time channel with hardware
properties into metrics for higher layer metrics of the database is a key enabler.

6.2.3 Objectives for Efﬁcient Energy and QoS Management
We determine the set of quality, energy cost and resource dimensions that are rel-
evant to the considered scenario where users transmit video data towards a central
AP (Fig. 6.2).
1. Cost Function (Ci): The optimization objective considered in the design case in
this chapter is to minimize the total energy consumption of all users in terms of
Joules/Job. For example, in a video context, a job is the timely delivery of the
current frame of the video application.
2. QoS Constraint (Qi): The optimization has to be carried out taking into account
a minimum performance or QoS in order to satisfy the user. As delivery of real-
time trafﬁc is of interest, we describe the QoS in terms of a single QoS metric
which is in this design case deﬁned to be the job failure rate (JFR) [85]. JFR is
deﬁned as the ratio of the number of frames not successfully delivered before
the deadline to the number of frames issued by the application over the lifetime
of the ﬂow. In this speciﬁc delay-sensitive video context, the QoS constraint is
hence speciﬁed at run-time by user i as a target JFR∗
i . This QoS deﬁnition could

6.2
Anticipation Through Design Time Modeling
95
be extended to a broader range of quality targets. We note again that, next to this
explicit QoS constraint that can be adapted or conﬁgured at run-time, application
bitrate constraints are implicit constraints given through by the use of scenarios.
3. Shared Resource (Ri): In this dissertation, we consider the particular case where
access to the channel is only divided in time. The fraction of resource consumed
by node i is denoted by Ri.
To summarize, each ﬂow Fi is associated with a set of possible system states Si,m,
which affects the mapping of the control dimensions Ki to the Cost (Ki,Si,m →Ci),
Resource (Ki,Si,m →Ri) and Quality (Ki,Si,m →Qi) that will be speciﬁed in
the next section. It is essential to note that for each user, depending on the current
state, the relative energy gains possible by rate scaling or sleeping are different and
should hence be exploited differently. Each user experiences different channel and
application dynamics, resulting in different system states over time, which may or
may not be correlated with other users. This is a very important characteristic which
makes it possible to exploit multi-user diversity for energy efﬁciency.
As the system performance requirements are speciﬁed at the application layer and
the energy consumption is at the lower (hardware) layers, it is essential to: (a) trans-
late the application layer requirements to relevant metrics at each intermediate layer
and (b) to deﬁne clean interfaces between layers for an Energy-Performance feed-
back mechanism (see Fig. 6.7). This is to allow for a local calibration of the hard-
ware which makes implementation more feasible, still enabling translation of to
application speciﬁc quality metrics. For delay-sensitive trafﬁc, the QoS metric of
interest is the target JFR∗.
At the link-layer, each application frame is fragmented into one or more ﬁxed-
sized fragments. An application frame size or rate requirements are hence translated
into a local Queue Size. Next, as shown in Fig. 6.7, the JFR∗is translated at the
link layer to a PER constraint, which corresponds to a maximum Block Error Rate
(BlER) as a function of the physical layer low-level knobs. The BlER is a result of
the receive SINAD for given PHY parameters. Each target JFR may be satisﬁed by
one or more control dimension conﬁgurations, Ki, each associated with the energy
consumed (cost) and time required (resource) to complete the frame transmission in
the current system state. The state is deﬁned by a discrete channel state and trafﬁc
requirement (i.e. current frame size), which can easily be monitored as the Queue
Size. Channel classiﬁcation and monitoring is typically a more difﬁcult problem.
At run-time, based on a node’s current system state and JFR∗, the corresponding
Cost-Resource set of points are fetched from memory. From each curve, conﬁgu-
ration settings are then chosen using the fast greedy algorithm such that the total
transmission time for all nodes is less than the deadline. We ﬁrst discuss the control
dimension mapping to obtain those Pareto-optimal trade-off sets.
6.2.4 Anticipating the Performance
The key aspects of the method for design of an energy efﬁcient cognitive radio
are the mapping of the control dimensions to cost, resource and quality proﬁles

Anticipative Energy and QoS Management
Fig. 6.7 A smart radio design approach spans multiple layers with corresponding performance
metrics. The case study demonstrates the energy management methodology in the 802.11a WLAN
setting
Fig. 6.8 At design-time, a Cost, Resource and Quality proﬁle is determined for each set of control
dimensions based on the system state. The optimal Cost-Resource-Quality trade-off is derived from
this mapping to give operating points used at run-time
respectively, and the generality of this mapping. A resource (respectively cost, qual-
ity) proﬁle describes a list of potential resource (respectively cost, quality) alloca-
tion schemes resulting from each conﬁguration point. These proﬁles are then com-
bined to give a Cost-Resource-Quality trade-off, which is essential for solving the
resource allocation problem (Fig. 6.8). The Cost-Resource-Quality trade-off func-
tion represents the behavior of a speciﬁc system for one user in a given system
state.
Cost proﬁle properties
• The ﬁnite set of discrete control dimension conﬁgurations can be ordered by
their increasing cost.
• The overall system cost, Cnet, is deﬁned as the weighted sum of costs of
all ﬂows, where each ﬂow can be assigned a certain weight depending on
its relative importance or to improve fairness [86]. Users may be assigned
higher weights for example when their battery capacity is low or when they
downscale their transmission rate by decreasing the video quality and get re-
warded for reducing the network congestion. Users with a higher weight will
typically be allowed to save more energy compared to other users: Cnet =
n
i=1 ωiCi.

6.2
Anticipation Through Design Time Modeling
97
Resource proﬁle properties
• The ﬁnite set of discrete control dimension conﬁgurations can be ordered ac-
cording to minimal resource requirement.
• The system resource requirement, R, is deﬁned as the sum of the per ﬂow
requirements: R = N
i=1 Ri.
Quality proﬁle properties
• The ﬁnite set of discrete control dimension conﬁgurations can be ordered with
quality.
• The system quality, Q, is met when each individual user’s constraint is met:
JFRi ≤JFR∗
i , 1 ≤i ≤n.
The ﬁnite set of discrete control dimensions can be ordered, describing a range
of possible costs, resources and quality for the system in each system state. For each
additional unit of resource allocated, we only need to consider the conﬁguration
that satisﬁes the quality constraint and achieves the minimal cost for that resource
unit. For each system state (e.g., channel and application loads), a subset of points
is determined by pruning the Cost-Resource-Quality set of points to yield only the
minimum cost conﬁgurations, which will be denoted by Ci(Ri,Qi).
We deﬁne a calibration function pi, that is computed for every state Si,m
pi(Ri,Qi) = min

Ci | (Ki,Si,m →Ri) ∧(Ki,Si,m →Qi)
∧(Ki,Si,m →Ci) ∧(Ki) ∈{Ki}

and deﬁnes a mapping between the Resource, Cost and the Quality of a node in
a system state, Si,m, as shown in Fig. 6.8. {Ki} is the set of conﬁguration vectors
for node i. Given the points after calibration in the Cost-Resource-Quality space,
we are only interested in the ones that represent optimally the trade-off between
energy, resource and quality for our system. Although the discrete settings and non-
linear interactions in real systems do not lead to a convex trade-off, it can be well
approximated as follows.
We calculate the convex minorant [87] of these pruned curves along the Cost,
Resource and Quality dimensions, and consider the intersection of the results. We
call this set the optimal Cost-Resource-Quality trade-off in the remainder. The
optimal Cost-Resource-Quality trade-off is plotted in the dimensions TXOP-JFR-
Energy/frame in Fig. 6.9(a) for the considered 802.11a WLAN design case. We
will show later that the maximum segment size of the convex minorant determines
the solution’s deviation from the optimum.2 Conﬁgurations on segments that are
small compared to the largest segment size can be pruned away without affecting
the bounds of the solution. As a result, we can typically expect less than 30 conﬁg-
urations per state. At run-time, the resource allocation scheme in the AP adapts to
2To achieve an optimum, it is necessary to retain the set of points that are Pareto-optimal or domi-
nant in the Cost-Resource-Quality dimensions. A complex optimization problem with backtracking
has to be solved at run-time to achieve the optimum based on the Pareto-points.

the system state by fetching the correct conﬁgurations from memory. This operation
is cheap compared to the cost of calibration that only has to be carried out once.
In the next subsection we detail how this information can be combined efﬁciently
into a global set representing the network trade-off. Proﬁling each user separately
and combining the information at run-time is optimal for independent users or when
the correlation is unknown. When correlation is present and known, the number of
system states to calibrate and the run-time combination could be further reduced.
6.3 Managing the User Experience
We ﬁrst formally state the energy efﬁcient cognitive radio resource allocation prob-
lem to be solved at run-time. Then we propose a very efﬁcient algorithm to achieve
the network-wide optimal conﬁguration.
6.3.1 Smart Resource Allocation Problem Statement
We recall that our goal is to assign transmission grants via the AP, resulting in an
optimal setting of the control dimensions to each ﬂow and node such that the per-
ﬂow QoS constraint for multiple users are optimally met with minimal energy con-
sumption. For a given set of resources, control dimensions and QoS constraints, the
scheduling objective can be formally stated as:
min
Cnet
n

i=1
ωiCi,
1 ≤m ≤s

(6.10)
The solution of the optimization problem yields a set of feasible operating points,
¯K = {Ki, 1 ≤i ≤n}, for the network which fulﬁll the QoS target, maintain the
shared resource constraint and minimize the system cost. While the proﬁle mapping
and pruning is done during a one-time calibration step, we now propose how the
optimal conﬁguration ¯K is determined efﬁciently at run-time using those proﬁles.
6.3.2 Greedy Resource Allocation
As the current system state of all the nodes and ﬂows is only known at run-time,
a light-weight scheme is necessary to assign the best system conﬁgurations for each
user, while meeting the QoS requirements. We therefore employ a greedy algorithm
to determine the per-ﬂow resource usage Ri for each ﬂow to minimize the total
cost Cnet while meeting the system constraints. The algorithm ﬁrst constructs the
optimal local Cost-Resource trade-off curve Ci(Ri) by taking the optimal points in
both dimensions that meet the run-time average quality constraint JFR∗. Next, the
scheduler traverses all ﬂows’ two-dimensional Cost-Resource curves and at every
step consumes resources corresponding to the maximum negative slope across all
ﬂows (taking into account user preference or weight if appropriate). This ensures
that for every additional unit of resources consumed, the additional cost saving is
the maximum across all ﬂows taking into account the agreements made at admission
time. We assume that the current channel states and application demands are known.
The exchange of state information and operating points between nodes and the AP
is obtained by coupling the MAC protocol with the resource manager as explained
in the next section.
We determine the optimal additional allocation to each ﬂow, Ri > 0, 1 ≤i ≤n,
subject to n
i=1 Ri ≤R. Our greedy algorithm is based on Kuhn–Tucker [87]:
1. Allocate to each ﬂow the smallest resource for the given state, Rmin. By assump-
tion, all ﬂows are schedulable under worst-case conditions, i.e., n
i=1 Rmin ≤R.
2. Let the current normalized allocation of the resource to ﬂow Fi be Ri, 1 ≤i ≤n.
Let the unallocated quantity of the available resource be Ravl.
3. Identify the ﬂow with the maximum negative slope, |C′
i(Ri)|, representing the
maximum decrease in cost per resource unit (i.e. moving right and downward
the Ci(Ri) convex minorant in Fig. 6.10). If there is more than one, pick one
randomly. If the value of the minimum slope is 0, then stop. No further allocation
will decrease the system cost further.

Anticipative Energy and QoS Management
Fig. 6.10 Bounded deviation
from the optimal in discrete
Cost-Resource curves
4. Increase Ri by the amount till the slope changes for the ith ﬂow. Decrement Ravl
by the additional allocated resource and increment the cost C by the consequent
additional cost. Return to step 3 until all resources have been optimally allocated
or when Ravl is 0.
In our implementation, we sort the conﬁguration points at design-time in the de-
creasing order of the negative slope between two adjacent points. The complexity
of the run-time algorithm is O(Lnlog(n)) for n nodes (∼20) and L conﬁguration
points per curve. Further in this chapter, we demonstrate that for a practical system
in each possible system state (i.e., channel and frame size), the number of conﬁg-
uration points to be considered at run-time is relatively small (∼30). Taking into
account that the relation Ci(Ri) is convex, we now prove that the greedy algorithm
leads to the optimal solution for continuous resource allocation. Following that, we
extend the proof for systems with discrete working points to show that the solution
is within a bound from the optimal.
Theorem 4.1 For a continuous resource allocation to be optimal, a necessary con-
dition is ∀i, 1 ≤i ≤n, Ri = 0, or for any ﬂows {i,j} with Ri > 0 and Rj > 0, the
cost slopes C′
i(Ri) = C′
j(Rj).
Proof For a continuous differentiable function, the Kuhn–Tucker [87] theorem
proves such a greedy scheme is optimal. Suppose for some i ̸= j, let the optimal
resources be Ri > 0, Rj > 0, and |C′
i(Ri)| > |C′
j(Rj)|. As the savings in cost per
resource for Fi is larger, we can subtract an inﬁnitesimal amount of resource from
Fj and add it to Fi. Total system cost is reduced, contradicting the assumed opti-
mality.
□
In a real system, however, the settings for different control dimensions such as
modulation or transmit power are discrete. This results in a deviation, , from the
optimal resource assignment. We now show this worst-case deviation  from the
optimal strategy is bounded and small.

6.4
IEEE 802.11a Design Case
101
Theorem 4.2 ∃0 ≤ < ∞, such that COPT ≤CMEERA ≤COPT + , where COPT
is the optimal cost (energy consumed by all users) and CMEERA is the cost in the
discrete case.
Proof For all ﬂows, {F1,F2,...,Fn}, the aggregate system resources consumed
are stored in the decreasing order of their negative slope across all per-ﬂow Cost-
Resource Ci(Ri) curves. Based on this ordering, the aggregate system C(R) trade-
off is constructed, consisting of segments resulting from individual ﬂows. The
greedy algorithm traverses the aggregate system C(R) curve, consisting of succes-
sive additional resource consumptions (at maximum cost decrease), until the ﬁrst
segment, s, is found that requires more resources than the residual resource Ravl
(Fig. 6.10).
Let the two end points of the ﬁnal segment s be (rs,cs) and (rs+1,cs+1) in
C(R). Let (rc,cc) be the optimal resource allocation in the optimal combined Cost-
Resource curve.
COPT ≥CMEERA −(rc −rs)(cs+1 −cs)/(rs+1 −rs)
> CMEERA −(rs+1 −rs)(cs+1 −cs)/(rs+1 −rs)
= CMEERA −(cs+1 −cs).
We observe that cs −cs+1 ≤, therefore CMEERA −COPT < . Moreover, we note
that with more dimensions (Ki,j) considered, a better approximation can be ob-
tained.
□
6.4 IEEE 802.11a Design Case
To demonstrate the usability of the proposed control scheme we apply it to control
a ﬂexible OFDM 802.11a modem. The target application is the delivery of delay-
sensitive trafﬁc over a slow fading channel with multiple users. We associate the
system Cost to energy, the Resource to the time over the shared medium and the
Quality is the JFR.
We brieﬂy consider the trade-offs present across the physical circuits, digital
communication settings and link layer in our system. Increasing the modulation
constellation size decreases the transmission time but results in a higher PER for
the same channel conditions and PA settings. The energy savings due to decreased
transmission time must offset the increased expected cost of re-transmissions. Also,
increasing the transmit power increases the signal distortion due to the PA nonlin-
earity [81]. On the other hand, decreasing the transmission power also decreases
the efﬁciency of the PA. Considering the trade-off between sleeping and scaling,
a longer transmission at a lower and more robust modulation rate needs to com-
pensate for the opportunity cost of not sleeping earlier. Finally, as all users share a
common channel, lowering the rate of one user reduces the time left for other delay-
sensitive users. This compels other users to increase their rate and consume more
energy or experience errors.

6.4.1 Energy-Performance Anticipation
Four control dimensions for the physical layer have been introduced to steer energy
and performance of these OFDM transceivers. As function of these control dimen-
sions, the energy ETx(Ki) needed to send and the energy ERx(Ki) needed to receive
a unit of Lfrag bytes need to be characterized.
We realistically assume that the energy consumption of the digital baseband
is a linear function of the number of symbols to decode (ER
DSP and ET
DSP in en-
ergy/symbol). For the turbo coder, the energy cost depends on the number of bits
to decode (ER
DSP in energy/bit) at the receiver [77]. The block size used for the
turbo coding is 288 bits. Based on current implementations [78], the frequency syn-
thesizer, Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC),
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer (LNA) and ﬁlters are assumed to have a ﬁxed front-end power
consumption PFE as given in Table 6.1. The time needed to wake-up the system
(stabilization time for the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in the frequency synthesizer)
is assumed to be 100 µs, which is optimistic but can be achieved when designing
frequency generators for this purpose. Application layer frames are fragmented at
the link layer into Lfrag-sized fragments. We obtain the following expressions for
the energy needed to send or receive a fragment of length Lfrag, as a function of the
current knob settings:

Finally, to complete the model, we introduce a term Pidle that denotes the power
consumption when the transceiver is idle (Table 6.1).
Obtaining the actual values for energy consumption for each of the conﬁgura-
tions only depends on the fragment size, and the analog and digital baseband power
consumption values as function of the conﬁguration settings. In practice, this in-
formation is obtained very fast by transmitting a Lfrag packet once (requiring 0.1
to 1.3 ms depending on the conﬁguration) using e.g. 1000 conﬁgurations (hence
1.3 × 10−3 × 1000 = 1.3 s for a complete system proﬁle). It is acceptable to spend

this time since this calibration only needs to be carried out once over the system
lifetime and gives us sufﬁcient information to fully characterizes the device’s en-
ergy and performance as function of the control dimensions considered.
We now have expressions for the gross transmission rate (Eq. 6.1) and for the
energy consumption to send Lfrag bits. However, to obtain the complete energy and
performance models, we have to also take into account all overheads and compute
the total energy and resource cost for each scenarios.
For each combination of feasible control dimensions of node i, Ki (which we will
simplify to K), we compute the total expected energy consumption, total transmis-
sion time and resulting JFR while using the properties of a sleep-enabled 802.11e
MAC. We assume that during each communication instance, all transmissions use
the same conﬁguration to eliminate reconﬁguration costs. All transmissions em-
ploy the contention-free mode with transmit opportunity (TXOP) grants of 802.11e
HCCA [88]. Let EH , EACK and TH , TACK be the pre-determined energy and time
needed to transmit a header and acknowledgment. The energy and time needed
for a successful Egood and failed3 Ebad transmission is then determined following
Fig. 6.11 and using parameters listed in Table 6.1:
Egood(K) = ETx + EH + (2TsifsPidle) + EACK,

We now include the MAC layer retransmissions. Each fragment is transmitted with
conﬁguration K, for which we can determine the Packet Error Rate Pe, based on
Eq. 6.4. The probability that the frame is delivered with exactly (m + p) attempts
(including p retransmissions), is given by the recursion:

The third term H(K) denotes the cost that has to be added once every scheduling
period. We will show later that this cost corresponds to a wake-up cost only and no
reconﬁguration cost should be taken into account, where we assume that the cost for
each conﬁguration K is constant.
We determine the Energy-Time-JFR trade-off as a function of the system state
and number of retransmissions for each K. This speciﬁes the full proﬁle for the
system, and is determined only once during design or calibration time. These can
then be combined into the 3D proﬁles of the system (Fig. 6.9(a)). This cost, resource
and quality proﬁle information is stored in each node’s driver. We further prune the
3D proﬁle to obtain per-ﬂow Energy-TXOP curves. Conﬁguration points that do
not meet the target JFR∗are pruned. Next, the convex minorant is computed in
both Energy and TXOP dimensions. The resulting two-dimensional Pareto-optimal
trade-off curves are shown in Fig. 6.12 for the considered channel and frame size
scenarios.

scheme described in Sect. 6.3.2. The scheduler requires feedback on the state of
each user and then communicates the decisions to the users. In order to instruct a
node to sleep for a particular duration, the AP needs to know when to schedule the
next packet. Waking a node earlier than the schedule instance will waste energy.
Buffering just two frames informs the AP of the current and also the next trafﬁc de-
mand, allowing a timely scheduling and communication of the next period TXOP. In
the ACK, the AP instructs the node to sleep until the time of the next TXOP mean-
while also communicates the required conﬁguration. The AP now communicates
with each node only at scheduling instances (Fig. 6.13). As the real-time packets
are periodic, we eliminate by doing so all idle time between transmission instances.
When a node joins a network, it sends its cost, resource and quality curves (stored in
its driver) to the AP during the association phase. The AP then stores this and refers
to it during each scheduling instance. By adding just three bytes in the MAC header
for the current channel state and the two buffered frame sizes, each node updates the
AP of its current requirement in every transmission. Protocols such as 802.11e pro-
vide support for this communication and therefore require only minor modiﬁcations.
The AP then fetches the predetermined set for the current state from memory. In the

106
6
Anticipative Energy and QoS Management
case study, this corresponds to less than 3000 bits per state. A software-based QoS
Module within the AP’s network management layer maintains the list segments of
all associated nodes and processes the current state of each node. At the beginning of
each period, it executes the run-time phase of the control method and determines the
conﬁguration for each node during that period. The scheduling period requirement
is determined by the rate at which the system state varies. Channel measurements
show coherence times of 166 ms for stationary objects and moving scatterers [37].
Given a video frame rate of 30 ms, it is clear that this requires a scheduling period
less than 30 ms. Since this timing requirement is rather low, a software module is
sufﬁcient. Alternatively, the QoS module can be integrated in a light-weight RTOS
present in most embedded devices (as done in [89]). We expect the performance of
the control method be lower for mobile networks with faster state dynamics, when
it is difﬁcult to feedback the system state timely. Faster adaptation schemes will
be needed that integrate the adaptation module in hardware close to the physical
layer [90].
6.5 Adapting to the Dynamic Context
We now show how a cognitive radio can save energy by optimally adapting to the
varying context. More speciﬁcally, the smart radio knows how to adapt its ﬂexibil-
ity across many layers to achieve the best conﬁguration in terms of QoS, energy or
resource use. The focus is on real-time streaming media applications with a reason-
able target JFR∗set to 10−3. In order to evaluate the relative performance of the
cognitive control method, we consider four comparative transmission strategies:
1. Smart: This is the optimal scheme considering the energy trade-off between
sleep and scaling, exploiting multi-user diversity. The node conﬁgurations are
based on the proﬁles of Sect. 6.4.1.
2. PHY-layer: This scheme considers only physical layer scaling knobs. The
Energy-TXOP proﬁles are set to scale maximally as no sleep mode is available.
3. MAC-layer: In this scheme only sleeping is possible by the energy-aware MAC-
layer. The physical layer is ﬁxed to the largest constellation and code rate, with
maximum transmit power. This approach is used by commercial 802.11 de-
vices [8]. However, the 2-frame buffering makes the proposed implementation
more efﬁcient as it eliminates all idle time between transmissions.
4. Fixed: Similar to MAC-layer scheme but the transceiver remains in idle after
transmission. A basic scheme with no energy management and hence no dynamic
range is exploited here.
The Energy-TXOP proﬁles are computed for the control dimensions considered in
each scheme and used by the scheduling scheme implemented in the Network Simu-
lator ns-2 [91]. This simulator has been extended with transceiver energy and perfor-
mance models, and a slow fading channel model. Our simulation model implements
the functions of the 802.11e with beaconing, polling, TXOP assignment, uplink, and
downlink frame exchange, fragmentation, retransmission and variable super-frame

consumption across different
channel states for 1 fragment
sizing. In all results, the total energy consumed by a node is averaged over a long
duration to statistically capture the dynamics present in the scenario.
Consider the scenario where a single user has to deliver a unit frame every
scheduling period. In Fig. 6.14, the energy consumption (normalized by the maxi-
mum energy consumed by Fixed) is plotted for the four schemes over different chan-
nel states. The anticipative adaptation method outperforms the other techniques in
each state, since it takes advantage of the energy that can be saved by both sleeping
and scaling. The energy needed to transmit a data fragment increases from best to
worst channel state due to a combination of (a) the lower constellation needed to
meet the PER (hence smaller sleep duration), (b) a higher required output power
to account for the channel and (c) the increased cost of retransmissions. We ob-
serve, for example, that in the best channel state, the energy consumption is low
for both the ﬁxed and global approaches, and energy gains primarily result from
sleeping. However, in the bad channel state the transmission energy is more im-
portant and scaling becomes more effective. The ratio of ﬁxed to scalable energy
varies as transceivers are designed differently. The take this into account during the
calibration of system proﬁles. For a given platform, as users demand different lev-
els of QoS, the proposed method jointly leverages the MAC and PHY to maximize
the energy savings. A smart radio with control ﬂexibility along many protocol lay-
ers, should know how to adapt to ensure an optimal user experience, energy use or
resource use.
6.6 Conclusions
In this chapter it was shown how a ﬂexible radio can be designed to meet the tar-
get QoS at minimal energy consumption for a set of anticipated scenarios. Flexible
radios often have many different control knobs that can be tuned to save energy or
boost performance. When many different knobs exist across many different layers,

it becomes hard to anticipate the optimal conﬁguration at design time. It was shown
in this chapter how to achieve this for a 802.11a ﬂexible radio. In the next section, it
will be shown how a cognitive radio can be designed when the optimal conﬁguration
cannot be known perfectly at design time.

Distributed Optimization of Local Area
Networks
7.1 Introduction
In Chap. 5, we have demonstrated why the ISM bands can be considered the most
complex wireless scene today. In these bands different heterogeneous networks and
devices co-exist using only LBT etiquettes. The IEEE 802.11 standard is by far the
most popular wireless standard for broadband access operating in the ISM bands. It
is widely recognized that the throughput of IEEE 802.11 networks is dependent on
all of the following parameters:
• Increasing the transmission rate will increase the number of packets that are sent
during a time interval, but more packets can be lost at the receiver due to a lower
interference tolerance.
• Lowering the carrier sense threshold protects a packet against interference, but
decreases transmission opportunities by silencing the transmitter more often.
• Increasing the transmission power will decrease packet losses at the receiver,
but will also reduce spatial reuse in the network.
In this chapter, we introduce a novel control algorithm, Spatial Learning, which
learns the optimal operating point in this 3D design space at RT.
The model of IEEE 802.11 that we have presented in [46], can be used to in-
vestigate the relative importance of the different starvation mechanisms. However,
the assumptions remain restricting for effective RT control. In this contribution, we
have for instance assumed all terminals have the same power, rate and carrier sense
threshold. It is unlikely that in an optimal setting, all terminals will have the same
parameters. Indeed, terminals can be in different scenarios that demand for differ-
ent settings. Hence, if we allow terminals to select their parameters individually the
network throughput can further increase. Also, if we would need to ensure that all
terminals have the same parameters, changes need to be communicated over the
entire network [92]. The large overhead involved reduces throughput and possibly
eliminates the adaptation beneﬁt. Completely relying on DT modeling will hence
not result in an effective RT control. Therefore, we have designed Spatial Learning
relying on the framework presented in Chap. 3. The environment is split up into

different scenarios and for each scenario a DT policy is built. However, to be de-
tectable the scenarios used in this chapter cover a large amount of run-time situation
and the optimal strategy for each run-time situation is not the same, as it’s highly
dependent on the situation of its neighbors. Therefore, learning becomes necessary
to calibrate the DT policy for the observed scenario to optimally ﬁt the experienced
run-time situation.
Our novel algorithm exhibits the following desired properties for an IEEE 802.11
control algorithm [93]. It’s a single-channel solution and maintains interoperability
with other standards. Furthermore it is backward compatible with all IEEE 802.11
protocols as long as a terminal has a tunable power, rate and carrier sense threshold
selection.
A lot of work has been done on optimizing these control parameters individu-
ally [94–96]. More recently, the optimization of two parameters at once has been
investigated [97, 98]. To the best of our best knowledge, this chapter presents one
of the ﬁrst algorithms that tries to optimize all three parameters simultaneously.
This chapter is structured as follows. First, we present related work in Sect. 7.2.
Our benchmark solution, Spatial Backoff, is explained in more detail in Sect. 7.2.2.
We also explain the possibilities, remaining for future control algorithms. Our con-
trol algorithm, Spatial Learning, is discussed in Sect. 7.3. Simulation results are
presented in Sect. 7.4. Finally, we present our concluding remarks in Sect. 7.5.
7.2 Existing Flexibility and Control Mechanisms
In this section we present some of the recent work on IEEE 802.11 optimization and
present a general overview of multi-agent learning, i.e., when multiple terminals
learn simultaneously.
7.2.1 Optimization of IEEE 802.11 Networks
Here, we present an overview of different algorithms that exploit the ﬂexibility of
transmission rate, carrier sense threshold or transmission power.
7.2.1.1 Transmission Rate
The main goal of rate adaptation algorithms is to determine the current channel state
and select the optimal data rate accordingly.
One of the earliest rate adaptation algorithms is called Automatic Rate Fallback
(ARF) [99]. Here, the rate is increased after S consecutive successful transmissions
and dropped after F consecutive failures. ARF was improved by dynamically tun-
ing S and F with Binary Exponential Backoff [100]. This avoids overprobing high
rates and overutilization of low rates. Receiver-Based AutoRate (RBAR) monitors

7.2
Existing Flexibility and Control Mechanisms
111
the Signal-to-Noise Ratio at the receiver, which is signaled to the transmitter using
the RTS/CTS mechanism [101]. Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) tries to exploit the
time when channel quality is high, by sending data packets back-to-back in these
conditions [102]. In recent years, rate adaptation has focused on cross-layer tech-
niques, loss-differentiation and more efﬁcient feedback mechanisms [103–110].
7.2.1.2 Carrier Sense Threshold
Unlike the transmission rate, the ﬂexibility of carrier sense threshold has been less
explored. However, even recent papers show analytically the importance of an opti-
mized carrier sense threshold for individual and system-wide throughput [46, 111,
112]. Here, we present some recent algorithms that try to optimize IEEE 802.11
networks by adapting the carrier sense threshold.
In [113], the authors show that the optimal choice of the CS threshold depends on
node density and propose a distributed algorithm for local CS threshold optimization
based on a local estimation of node density.
In [114], the authors use the carrier sense threshold to mitigate neighborhood
starvation effects in ad hoc networks. This is done by detecting neighborhood star-
vation and increasing the carrier sense threshold in these situations.
In [115], the authors present an adaptation algorithm based on loss differentia-
tion. Here, all stations measure the Packet-Error-Rate (PER). A linear adaptation
algorithm, based on the highest PER in the network, is used to converge to an opti-
mal value.
7.2.1.3 Transmit Power
Power control for IEEE 802.11 networks can target either throughput maximiza-
tion, full network connectivity or energy efﬁciency. As the algorithm presented in
this section targets throughput maximization, we will focus our overview on these
algorithms.
In [116], the authors propose a control channel in order to inform other nodes
about their interference tolerance. The RTS/CTS handshake is used to solve the
asymmetric starvation problem.
In [94] it is recommended that links should scale down the transmission power
until they see an increase of collisions. The goal is to decrease interference towards
neighbors, without signiﬁcant impact on the individual throughput.
In [95], the hidden and exposed node problems are balanced out using power
control. The authors propose to decrease the transmission power of the link until
only the interference area is covered. We have shown that this approach need not be
optimal when considering neighbor location and neighborhood starvation [46].

Distributed Optimization of Local Area Networks
7.2.1.4 Hybrid Control
Many algorithms exploit more than one parameter. Here, we present some of these
hybrid control algorithms.
In [117] the authors present a power/rate adaptation algorithm that relies on the
RTS/CTS exchange. They propose to extend the range of RTS and CTS packets to
protect the CTS, DATA and ACK packets. This way, they try to remove all hidden
terminals.
In [97] and [96], it is recommended to keep the product of transmit power and
CS threshold constant in the network. In [97] this constant is found through Gibbs
sampling, while in [96] the optimal constant is experimentally established when the
network-wide PER is near-zero, which is optimal from a throughput perspective.
In [118], the authors investigate the effects of the 3 parameters on spatial reuse.
They show that spatial reuse only depends on the ratio of transmit power to car-
rier sense threshold in the case that the achievable channel rate follows Shannon’s
law. Furthermore, they claim that tuning transmission power should be preferred
over tuning the carrier sense threshold as terminals can then save energy addition-
ally. Based on this observation, the authors present a power and data rate adaptation
algorithm that uses the SINR as its input. Similar to [94], they suggest that termi-
nals should use the minimum transmission power needed to sustain high data rates.
Doing this, terminals achieve optimal throughput, while maximizing spatial reuse.
In [98] a spatial backoff contention resolution is presented. This is a heuristic al-
gorithm that tunes both carrier sense threshold and rate and we will use it to bench-
mark the performance of our hybrid DT/RT optimization algorithm.
7.2.2 Benchmark Solution: Spatial Backoff
In this section, we introduce Spatial Backoff (SB) as our main reference [98].
This algorithm tunes both rate and carrier sense threshold to optimize individual
throughput in IEEE 802.11 networks. We present an overview of the algorithm in
Sect. 7.2.2.1 and present opportunities for further improvements of the algorithm in
Sect. 7.2.2.2.
7.2.2.1 Algorithm Overview
Spatial Backoff assumes that the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol has a set of discrete
rates available. For each rate an associated carrier sense threshold, TCS, is deﬁned
as follows:
TCS[i] =
TRx
SINR[i],
(7.1)
where TRx is the receiver sensitivity (no packets with a power below TRx can be
received) and SINR[i] is the signal-to-interference-noise threshold for rate R[i].

7.2
Existing Flexibility and Control Mechanisms
113
Only when the SINR at the receiver exceeds SINR[i], packets can be received. It
is assumed that when using a TCS equal or lower than TCS[i] to transmit at rate i,
it is unlikely that the transmitter will overestimate the interference tolerance at the
receiver. Hence, we are looking for a TCS ≤TCS[i].
Transmitters start at the lowest rate, R[0] and its associated TCS[0]. When a cer-
tain number S of consecutive transmissions succeed, the rate is increased to R[i+1],
unless it’s already transmitting at the highest rate. Likewise, when a certain number
F of consecutive failures is seen, transmitters try to compensate by ﬁrst lowering
their TCS. This is done as long as the TCS is higher than TCS[i]. When the current
TCS of the transmitter is equal to TCS[i] and transmissions continue to fail, the rate
is decreased to R[i −1]. When decreasing to a lower rate, TCS is reset to its last
known successful value for R[i −1].
In order to stabilize on a certain point the number of consecutive transmissions
needed to increase rate is increased S[i], increases each time the transmitter falls
back to rate i. A similar procedure is used for failures.
7.2.2.2 Opportunities
In this section, we shortly describe opportunities that exist to improve SB. In the
next sections, we address these opportunities in the design of our control algorithm.
• Improve monitors
SB uses a starvation detection mechanism to avoid a complete loss of transmis-
sion opportunities. This mechanism (no transmission during a certain period of
time) is quite slow and only detects the most severe cases of starvation, when a
transmitter is deprived of all access to the medium.
• Increase the number of scenarios
SB only considers collisions. Collisions, however, are not always a good indica-
tor for throughput as a node may increase its throughput by using decreasing its
transmission rate, while increasing its carrier sense threshold. This can signiﬁ-
cantly increase the successful transmission opportunities.
• Improve DT policy
The selection of TCS[i] in SB is also quite defensive. Indeed, when the received
power is high, the transmitter doesn’t need to be as protective as when the received
power is equal to TRx.
• Improve RT policy
The proposed converging method can be quite slow, when the transmitter has a lot
of neighbors and occasionally a packet fails through a coordinated collision [92].
7.2.3 Multi-Agent Learning
In this section we give a short overview of the current research on multi-agent and
heuristic learning. Thorough reviews of the current state of research in these ﬁelds
can be found in [119–122].

114
7
Distributed Optimization of Local Area Networks
In [123], the authors describe what kind of engineering problems naturally lend
themselves to multi-agent learning. They strongly support the development of multi-
agent learning techniques starting from the application perspective. Also in [120],
the authors present a critical view on the advancement of multi-agent learning tech-
niques. They criticize the quest for convergence to equilibria, as these may be subop-
timal (e.g., the Nash equilibrium in the prisoner’s dilemma). They claim researchers
should start from the problem and see how they can improve over state-of-the-art
algorithms using these learning approaches.
In this chapter, we have tried to adopt this vision and have selected one of the sim-
plest multi-agent learning techniques, independent q-learning, and see how we can
use it in an engineering problem. Although convergence of independent q-learning
is not guaranteed, it has been shown that it can outperform those Nash equilibria by
ﬁnding mutually beneﬁcial conﬁgurations [124].
Nash q-learning is an alternative that is known to converge to a Nash equilibrium.
However, it requires to know the actions taken by all players. As the interference
ranges for IEEE 802.11 are larger than the transmission ranges, this is not possible
in our current scenario. Under these informational constraints, it has been proved
in [125] that, today, no algorithm exists that can converge to the Nash equilibrium.
This makes independent q-learning a viable candidate for the current problem.
In line with Chap. 3, we design DT procedures (heuristics) to speed up RT con-
vergence of the algorithm. Here, the use of these DT procedures can also improve
performance of the steady-state result. The use of heuristics improves the blind
learning methods, through the addition of domain knowledge in the learner. As men-
tioned above, the authors of [120, 123] strongly support this.
7.3 Spatial Learning: Distributed Optimization of IEEE 802.11
Networks
In this section, we explain our control algorithm for distributed optimization of
IEEE 802.11 networks, resulting from an instantiation of the smart radio framework
presented in Chap. 3. First, we introduce the instantiated framework in Sect. 7.3.1
and make the link with Chap. 3. Afterwards, we introduce the control dimensions
in Sect. 7.3.2. Scenario identiﬁcation is discussed in Sect. 7.3.3. Afterwards, we
introduce our DT procedures in Sect. 7.3.4. The learning engine to calibrate these
DT procedures is discussed in Sect. 7.3.5. In Sect. 7.3.6, we explain how the DT
procedures and the learning engine ﬁt together. Finally, we end this section with a
discussion on implementation details in Sect. 7.3.7.
7.3.1 The General Framework
In this section, we introduce the general framework of our new control algorithm,
Spatial Learning (see Fig. 7.1). Similar to the CR cycle in [16], the learner interprets

7.3
Spatial Learning: Distributed Optimization of IEEE 802.11 Networks
115
Fig. 7.1 General framework
how the environment reacts to the selected actions and adapts his actions accord-
ingly. As mentioned by Simon Haykin in his seminal paper: “The CR is therefore,
by necessity, an example of a feedback communication system”. Hence, feedback
is an essential part of the CR and, hence, of Spatial Learning.
In our current IEEE 802.11 scenario, the feedback from the environment is the
observed throughput. As mentioned above, this limited information assumption ex-
cludes the guaranteed convergence to a Nash Equilibrium, since the exact actions
taken by all players cannot be known [125]. As shown in Fig. 7.1, the learner is as-
sisted by heuristics, i.e., DT procedures. Heuristic recommendations for the learner
are based on a scenario identiﬁcation technique, that relies on local observations.
This in effect also increases the feedback information quality from the environ-
ment, which speeds up convergence, while increasing the performance during con-
vergence.
Below, we show how we instantiated the general framework in this case study
chapter. We also refer to the speciﬁc sections, where our selections are discussed in
more detail. As stated in Sect. 7.1, the considered control dimensions in this case
study chapter are the transmission power, transmission rate and carrier sense thresh-
old. In Sect. 7.3.2, we introduce the possible knob settings for each control dimen-
sion in the discrete state space. As deﬁned in Chap. 3, actions are the relative change
in knob settings. In this case study chapter, the actions are to increase or decrease
each knob if possible. When decreasing the rate, the carrier sense threshold is also
reset. Further details can be found in Sects. 7.3.4 and 7.3.5. The system scenarios
we consider in this instantiation are the hidden terminal starvation, neighborhood
starvation and asymmetric starvation and starvation-free scenario. The exposed ter-
minal problem cannot be monitored by local observation of the IEEE 802.11 ter-
minal so it cannot be considered as a system scenario. Instead, it is clustered in the
starvation-free scenario. Further details are presented in Sect. 7.3.3. We detect the
different system scenario using simple energy detection and collision detection. The
exact procedure of scenario identiﬁcation, based on these detection mechanism is
described in Sect. 7.3.3. To calibrate the DT policies, we use the theoretical sat-

116
7
Distributed Optimization of Local Area Networks
urated throughput as a feedback channel. The theoretical throughput is used, as
opposed to the actual observed throughput, to reduce the noise generated by the
backoff selection mechanism. The calculation of the theoretical throughput requires
the knowledge of the busy, idle, successful and collision probabilities. The feedback
channel is further discussed in Sect. 7.3.5.
7.3.2 The Control Dimensions
Here we describe in more detail the set of possible knob settings for our algorithm.
This state space is selected at design time by the operator. We restrict it to allow
faster convergence of the algorithm. Increasing the number of possible conﬁgura-
tions decreases convergence speed, but possibly allows more optimal results.
7.3.2.1 Rate
Due to the underlying modulation schemes, the rate is the most coarse-grained pa-
rameter and hence does not need any design-time restriction. We use all rates the
platform supports and use these to bound the more ﬂexible parameters: carrier sense
thresholds and power.
7.3.2.2 Transmission Power
As a rule-of-thumb, we select the number of transmission powers equal to
the number of available rates and distribute these uniformly over the interval
 max(Pt)
nR
,max(Pt)

, where nR is the number of available rates and max(Pt) the
maximum available transmission power.
7.3.2.3 Carrier Sense Threshold
Here, we describe how we select the deﬁnition of TCS[i], which is the most ﬂexible
parameter from an implementation point of view. Rather then relying on the same
states for each transmitter as done in [98], we allow the transmitter to select its
TCS[i] based on the path loss:
TCS[i] =
Pr
Pt
k
Pr
SINR[i] −σ 2
0

,
(7.2)
where Pt is the transmit power, Pr is the received power and σ 2
0 a model for the noise
power at the receiver. The operator can choose the parameter k from the interval
[−1,1]. The aggressive point, k = −1, assumes that the interference power suffers
from the same path loss as the link between transmitter and receiver. The defensive

7.3
Spatial Learning: Distributed Optimization of IEEE 802.11 Networks
117
Fig. 7.2 The network operator can select its k value from the interval [−1,1]. When the interferer
is assumed to be closest to the transmitter, an aggressive strategy can be used (k = −1). When the
interferer is assumed to be closest to the receiver, a defensive strategy needs to be employed. This
deﬁnes the selection of the carrier sense threshold according to (7.2)
point, k = 1, assumes that the interference power, when measured at the transmitter,
suffers an extra path loss from receiver to transmitter (see Fig. 7.2). Throughout the
remainder of this chapter, we will use a neutral setting (k = 0).
This CS setting implies that the transmitter needs to know the value of Pr. A com-
monly accepted way is to piggyback the received power estimated at the receiver in
the acknowledgment. As mentioned in [126], this has already been integrated in cur-
rent IEEE 802.11 commercial products (e.g., the Lucent ORiNOCO AP-1000 card).
Even when it would be difﬁcult to estimate the received power, SL will compensate
by selecting appropriate states within the state space.
We denote this improved state space as Pr-space. The state space described in
Sect. 7.2.2.1, will be referred to as TRx-space.
7.3.3 System Scenarios
In order to design the DT procedures (i.e., heuristic recommendations), we must ﬁrst
ﬁnd out which is the current scenario. We use scenario identiﬁcation techniques,
quite similar to those presented in [92]. The scenarios we can identify are the hid-
den terminal starvation, asymmetric starvation and neighborhood starvation and the
starvation-free scenario. Below, we describe how we can identify these different
scenarios.
• Hidden terminal starvation is the easiest to detect, as only an inspection of pc is
needed. Indeed, it is signaled through a high collision probability.
• Asymmetric starvation is detected as follows. We keep a timer from the begin-
ning of transmission until we can decrement our backoff timer. If a successful
transmission lasts longer than expected (the expected duration of a collision or
a successful transmission can be easily calculated), a neighboring node started

118

Distributed Optimization of Local Area Networks
Fig. 7.3 Different types of
starvation mechanism and the
way they are detected
transmitting during our transmission. This means that this node was not listening
to our transmission, but we are listening to his transmission. Hence, this is a clear
case of asymmetric starvation (see Fig. 7.3).
• Neighborhood starvation is detected by long busy times (see Fig. 7.3). Using
this detection mechanism, we cannot distinguish between slow neighbors and
neighborhood starvation. However, as the recommendation for this situation is
the same (you want to increase TCS), this does not really matter.
• The starvation-free scenario occurs when the above three scenarios are not iden-
tiﬁed.
7.3.4 Design-Time Procedures
The optimal operating point cannot be known at DT. However, for each scenario we
can identify possible escape procedures that may lead to better performance. We rely
on the learner to identify at RT the best actions among those possible. However, we
can already at DT devise procedures, also called heuristic recommendations here-
after, that are used as a seed for the learning engine.
In Fig. 7.4, we see the system scenario diagram. As the system scenario diagram
is based on the scenario identiﬁcation techniques presented in Sect. 7.3.3, it differs
from the state space presented in Sect. 7.3.2. The heuristic recommendations are
also shown and explained below.
Hidden Terminal Starvation
The hidden terminal starvation occurs when a large amount of packets fail (see
Sect. 7.3.3). This implies that the SINR at the receiver is too low for successful
packet transmission. Hence, the heuristic recommendation would be to either to
increase the SINR at the receiver or to lower the required SINR for successful packet
reception. This can be done by:
• increasing the transmission power: this increases the received power and, hence,
increases the SINR at the receiver,

• decreasing the carrier sense threshold: this lowers the interference at the receiver
and, hence, increases the SINR at the receiver,
• decreasing the transmission rate: this lowers the required SINR for successful
packet reception at the receiver.
Asymmetric Starvation
The asymmetric starvation problem occurs when terminal A is backing off for
terminal B. However, terminal B is not backing off for terminal A. Thus, terminal A
can try to remove this scenario by:
• increasing the transmission power: terminal A wants to make himself heard by
increasing the received power at terminal B,
• increasing the carrier sense threshold: terminal A wants to remove the asymmetric
starvation scenario by not listening to terminal B anymore.
Neighborhood Starvation
We have modeled neighborhood starvation in [46]. The only local action a termi-
nal can take to remove this scenario is to:
• increase the carrier sense threshold.
Starvation-Free Scenario
Also for the most ideal scenario, we can give heuristic recommendations:
• increase the transmission rate: the terminal tries to see whether a higher transmis-
sion rate can be sustained,
• decrease the transmission power: the terminal tries to see whether the current
transmission rate can be sustained at a lower transmission power. This decreases
the interference towards other terminals, allowing them to increase their trans-
mission rate.

transmitter can decide (if
possible) to stay, increase
rate, decrease TCS or decrease
rate. When decreasing the
rate, TCS is reset to TCS[0].
The states where TCS is
smaller than TCS[i] have been
pruned at DT
7.3.5 The Learning Engine
To ﬁnd the optimal operating point, we propose to use a learning based approach to
reﬁne the heuristic recommendations. The proposed learning scheme is Q-learning,
which does not need a model of the environment and can be used on line [67].
The Q-learning algorithm continuously estimates the values of state-action pairs.
In the current problem, an action is the transition from the current state (sc) to a
new state (sn). The value Q(sc,sn) is deﬁned as the expected discounted sum of
future payoffs obtained by going to the new state and following an optimal policy
thereafter. Once these values have been learned, the optimal action from any state
is the one with the highest Q-value. The standard procedure for Q-learning is as
follows. All Q-values are initialized to 0. During the exploration of the state space,
the Q-values are updated as follows:
Q(sc,sn) ←(1 −α)Q(sc,sn)
+ α

(1 −γ )r + γ
max
s∈A(sn)Q(sn,s)

,
(7.3)
where α is the forget factor and γ is the learning parameter.
To implement Q-learning we ﬁrst need to deﬁne the actions within the state space.
For simplicity reasons, we discuss ﬁrst the actions without power ﬂexibility. The
possible actions for an example with 3 available rates can be seen in Fig. 7.5. In each
state the transmitter can decide (if possible) to keep the current conﬁguration, to
increase the rate, to decrease the carrier sense threshold or to decrease the rate. When
decreasing the rate, the transmitter is forced to reset its TCS to TCS[0]. The states
where TCS is smaller than TCS[i] have been pruned as explained in Sect. 7.3.2.3.
The reward r is deﬁned as the throughput increase for going to state sn:
r = S(sn) −S(sc),
(7.4)
where S(s) is the throughput seen in state s.
The Q-learning algorithm updates the estimate for each action, but in fact does
not specify what actions should be taken. It allows arbitrary experimentation while
at the same time preserving the current best estimate of the states’ values. For now,
we will use the following instantiation of simulated annealing. The nodes explore

7.3
Spatial Learning: Distributed Optimization of IEEE 802.11 Networks
121
using a soft-max policy, where each node selects an action with a probability given
by the Boltzmann distribution [127]:
pQ(sc,sn) =
e
Q(sc,sn)
T

∀s∈A(sc) e
Q(sc,s)
T
,
(7.5)
where T is the temperature that controls the amount of exploration. For higher val-
ues of T the actions are equiprobable. By annealing the algorithm (cooling it down)
the policy becomes more and more greedy. We use the following annealing scheme,
denoting θ the annealing factor:
Tk+1 ←θTk.
(7.6)
To further improve network-wide throughput and fairness, we allow transmitters
to tune their power. It has been established that the best response is to always send
at a higher power. This will lead to the Nash equilibrium, where all terminals are
using the maximum power. Hence, we need to give nodes a small incentive to scale
down the power. We do this by introducing a cost for using higher powers:
r(p)(sn,sc) = ρ(in)S(sn) −ρ(ic)S(sc),
(7.7)
where i is the power index (i = 0 refers to the lowest power). The reward with power
rewards is denoted as r(p). The reward factors are deﬁned as follows:
ρ(i) = ρi:
i ∈[0,np −1],
(7.8)
where ρ is an element of (0,1] and np is the number of available transmission
powers.
With a high ρ, nodes will scale down their power, until they see a drop in through-
put. This is somewhat similar to the power control mechanism described in [94].
With a lower ρ, they will even accept a throughput reduction.
Similar to the heuristic recommendation for starvation-free scenarios (see
Sect. 7.3.4), we allow links with a good channel to scale down their power without
dropping their throughput. As a result interference levels drop for the surround-
ing links. These links may now be able to send at a higher rate, which improves
network-wide throughput and fairness.
7.3.6 Seeding the Learning Engine with the DT Procedures
For each (combination of) scenario(s), we have deﬁned heuristic recommendations
in Sect. 7.3.4. For instance, when a node is dealing with asymmetric starvation, it
makes sense to either increase the power or decrease the carrier sense threshold in
order to alleviate this situation. At DT, we however do not know which of the two
actions is better.
Hence, we need to incorporate the heuristic recommendations in the Q-learning
mechanism, described above. The idea is that the heuristic recommendations are
followed during the exploration phase and that when the temperature cools down,

122
7
Distributed Optimization of Local Area Networks
the Q-learning takes over from the heuristic. This can be achieved by redeﬁning (7.5)
as follows:
pHQ(sc,sn) =
pH(sc,sn)e
Q(sc,sn)
T

∀s∈A(sc)(pH (sc,s)e
Q(sc,s)
T
)
.
(7.9)
An equiprobable distribution for pH turns (7.9) back into regular Q-learning.
The heuristic recommendations limit exploration for the Q-learning by avoiding
that the Q-learning algorithm visits dominated states. This speeds up convergence
and increases performance during convergence, as explained above.
We introduce the concept of heuristic bias. The heuristic bias, hb, deﬁnes how
much focus we put on the heuristic recommendations. The heuristic probabilities
are formed by weighing the number of recommended actions with hb and the action
to be avoided with 1
hb . The heuristic probabilities are then calculated as follows:
wH(a(+)) = hb,
(7.10)
wH(a(0)) = 1,
(7.11)
wH(a(−)) = 1
hb
,
(7.12)
pH(a) =
wH(a)
na(sc)
i=1
wH(i)
,
(7.13)
where wH is the heuristic weight, a(+) is a recommended action, a(0) is a neutral
action and a(−) is an action to be avoided. The number of actions in a certain state
is denoted as na(sc).
7.3.7 Implementation in the IEEE 802.11 MAC Protocol
We have deﬁned reward and actions in Sect. 7.3.5. Here, we detail the implemen-
tation of the algorithm in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. The basic concept is to
stay in one state for a certain time tu. After this timer has passed, the Q-values are
updated and a new state is selected according to (7.5).
7.3.7.1 The Reward
As we want to track the throughput as our reward (see Eqs. 7.4 and 7.7), a logical
choice would be to count the number of acknowledgments received during tu. How-
ever, the number of packets is highly dependent of the actual backoff values used
during the observation time. This noise may cause the learner to misinterpret the
rewards.

7.3
Spatial Learning: Distributed Optimization of IEEE 802.11 Networks
123
7.3.7.2 Theoretical Throughput Estimation
To remove the noise generated by the correlation between backoff selection and ob-
served throughput, we use the theoretical saturation throughput, S⋆, of IEEE 802.11
given by (13) in [128], rather than the actual observed throughput (r(s) = S⋆(s)).
This theoretical throughput is calculated based on 5 parameters: the collision prob-
ability pc, the busy probability pb, the length of a collision slot tc, the length of a
busy slot tb and the length of a successful slot ts.
By using transmissions as probes for pc, ts and tc and observing pb and tb when
the transmitter is not sending, we can calculate the theoretical throughput. This the-
oretical throughput is no longer dependent on the actual instantiations of the backoff
value.
7.3.7.3 Observation Reuse
As the observed throughput is still dependent on the backoff values and actions of
other transmitters in the neighborhood, not all noise is removed. This may cause the
learner to still misinterpret the rewards as shown in Fig. 7.6. As the transmitter has
no way of knowing the actions of other players (see Sect. 7.2), we try to accommo-
date this by averaging out these variations by observing the following relations:
pi = f (Pt,TCS),
(7.14)
tb = f (Pt,TCS),
(7.15)
pc = f (R,Pt,TCS),
(7.16)
tc = f (R,Pt,TCS),
(7.17)
ts = f (R,Pt,TCS).
(7.18)
We see that pi and tb are not rate-dependent. This means that the observation
of pi and tb in one state is also valid for all states that have the same carrier sense
threshold and transmission power. Hence, we are virtually checking these states and
we can update also the observations in these states.
We can also see that pc is dependent on all three parameters. However, if we
enable SINR-measurements at the receiver as done in [101], we can also virtually
update pc for the states that have higher rates, but equal transmission power and
carrier sense thresholds. In each acknowledgment the receiver piggybacks the SINR
it observed during reception of the packet. Using this SINR, we can ﬁnd out if
a higher-rate packet would have succeeded or not. Obviously, each failed attempt
would also have failed if it was transmitted at a higher rate. It is not possible to
update the pc observation for lower rates, because the packet wasn’t received and,
hence, no acknowledgment was sent. This means we have no way of ﬁnding out
whether a failed transmission would have been successful at the lower rates.
To further reduce the variance on the observations, we use ARMA ﬁlters to keep
track on all the individual parameters.

Fig. 7.6 Multi-agent q-learning using simulated annealing is not guaranteed to converge to a Nash
equilibrium. In this example, the Nash equilibrium is (L, D). However, during initial exploration,
when all the actions are equiprobable, player 2 may decide that U is the better choice as it has an
average proﬁt of 8 and D only yields a proﬁt of 5. As it is unaware of the actions taken by player 1,
player 2 fails to notice that player 1 settles on L. Hence, player 2 goes for the safe option where it
cannot be hurt by the exploration of player 1

7.4 Assessing the Gains
We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm through an extensive sim-
ulation study with the network simulator ns-2.29 [129].
All simulations are done using the simple path loss model of ns-2.29 without
shadowing. As can be seen in Table 7.1, we assumed terminals are capable of trans-
mitting at four discrete rates to make a fair comparison with [98]. We also used
four power levels. For parameters not present in Table 7.1 or Table 7.2 we used the
default values in ns-2.29.
First, we present an illustrative example that demonstrates the beneﬁts of the
different contributions. The scenario is presented in Fig. 7.7(a). In Fig. 7.7(b), we
can see that the TCS based on TRx is too defensive. Link 1 can increase its throughput
with a smarter state space selection. This, however, has a negative impact on link 2.
When using SL without power ﬂexibility, we can quickly converge. When we allow
link 1 to decrease its power, interference for link 2 reduces and it is able to sustain a
higher rate.

As illustrated in Fig. 7.8, we assumed that 802.11 Access Points form a hexago-
nal grid. The User Equipments (UEs) are distributed according to a spatial Poisson
point process with a density δ = 25 nodes
km2 . UEs are sending uplink trafﬁc using the
DCF mode. The results for a complete ad-hoc network are similar, but we believe
this topology is a better representation of 802.11 networks today.
Fig. 7.7 By allowing link 1 to use less defensive TCS, it can increase its throughput. This causes a
throughput drop for link 2. However, as link 1 reduces its power, while sustaining its throughput,
link 2 can support a higher rate due to a decreased interference level

Fig. 7.8 A centralized topology: 802.11 Access Points form a hexagonal grid. 802.11 User Equip-
ments are distributed randomly according to a spatial Poisson process. The UEs are associated with
the nearest access point
In Fig. 7.9, we present a comparison between SB and SL. Results are averaged
over 100 seeds, using the topology of Fig. 7.8. We can see that our new TCS deﬁ-
nition, based on Pr, signiﬁcantly increases throughput. The deﬁnition based on TRx
does not provide a lot of differentiation among the different states. This can be seen
by the fact that SL cannot improve over SB using these states and by the fact that it
reduces the transmission power signiﬁcantly for these states. However the introduc-
tion of the new states also causes more unfairness in the network as terminals are
less inclined to listen to each other and hidden terminals become more prominent.
By allowing the nodes to scale down power, SL compensates for this and reaches
the same levels of fairness1 as the TRx-states. Most importantly, SL is shown to
outperform SB by 33% in throughput using the Pr-based states.
The impact of heuristics on the convergence of SL is illustrated in Fig. 7.10.
Again, the topology of Fig. 7.8 is used and averaged over 100 seeds. It can be clearly
seen that the use of domain knowledge in the form of heuristics results in a signiﬁ-
cant increase in convergence speed.
To demonstrate the interoperability of SL, we show the performance of SL in
a legacy 802.11 network in Fig. 7.11. As most of the current commercial 802.11
cards support some kind of ARF, we have implemented this for the legacy 802.11

Fig. 7.9 Spatial Learning is shown to outperform Spatial Backoff by 33% in throughput using the
Pr-based states. It also reaches a better fairness index and lower power than SB
Fig. 7.10 We use the
heuristic recommendations to
speed up convergence. The
addition of heuristics to
Q-learning also allows to
converge to a better
steady-state solution. When
hb is equal to 1, heuristics are
not considered, as can be seen
in (7.10)–(7.13)
terminals [99]. We can see that SL performs better among legacy 802.11 terminals
as these cannot optimize their own transmissions fully, generating opportunities for
the SL terminals. However, adding more SL terminals doesn’t reduce the average
throughput of the SL terminals that much. This makes for a compelling business
case, where the ﬁrst adopters are rewarded the most.

exploited. However, a full SL

7.5 Conclusions
In this chapter we have presented a throughput model for large 802.11 networks.
This illustrates that the DT/RT method can handle very complex environments for
CRs. The proposed model is shown to match simulation results very accurately, and
hence gives the correct insight in the relative importance of the different starvation
sources on the expected throughput of large networks.
This model is however too rigid for RT control of IEEE 802.11 terminals. Hence,
we have presented a hybrid DT/RT control algorithm for tuning power, rate and car-
rier sense threshold. It is shown to outperform the reference algorithm Spatial Back-
off in network-wide throughput and power consumption. We believe distributed
optimization is a key topic in wireless communications as it is able to cut down
infrastructure and management cost. This is key for CR.
IEEE 802.11 has been selected as the supporting standard, since it is the most
prominent wireless standard that enables ad-hoc communication. In the future, we
expect a synergy between purely distributed optimization based on local information
and distributed optimization based on information exchange between the terminals.

Close
In this ﬁnal chapter of this book, we ﬁrst summarize its major conclusions. We intro-
duced design and operation approaches towards Smart(er) and Cognitive Software
Deﬁned Radios, and showed its application in particular stringent cases. Conse-
quently and ﬁnally, we end this chapter and book with some closing remarks. Many
open challenges still remain to realize the Anything, Anytime, Anywhere aspiration,
which deﬁnitely continues to be a moving target. Technological innovation is needed
to keep up the pace with increasing capacity requirements. Moreover, regulations,
economical and even social conditions have to be considered in order to ultimately
serve the users optimally.
8.1 “Good Enough” Is “Close Enough to Optimal”
Wireless services have attracted an impressively growing interest over the past
decades. This trend is expected to continue as ever more users want to exchange ever
more and richer information. Despite great progress in physical layer techniques, we
are however running out of wireless capacity. Novel solutions, both technological
and regulatory, are therefore needed to enable a sustainable growth in wireless com-
munication. This book focuses on opportunities opened up by the progress towards
smart(er) and cognitive radios. In Sect. 8.2 of this chapter we draw the attention to
complementary tactics which we believe will also be vital to keep the communica-
tion going. The smart(er) and cognitive operation of radios presented in this book,
exploit the possibilities offered by recent and emerging standards which enable a
more dynamic spectrum access (see Chap. 2). Consequently, radios that exploit
these new opportunities to adapt their behavior to the actual circumstances (both
in terms of service requirements and communication scenario) can achieve great
performance increase. We thereby adapt the taxonomy illustrated in Fig. 8.1. While
cognitive radios can especially bring added value when they are built upon ﬂexible
hardware (SDRs, reconﬁgurable radios), this is not the only form of ﬂexibility to be
exploited in the wireless environment. Therefore, the case studies discussed in this
book do not impose ﬂexible hardware as a prerequisite.

Fig. 8.1 Smart(er) to cognitive radio operation
We want to acknowledge to the readers that the boundaries between these classes
are not easy to draw. While a crystal clear separation would be desired, it is our
opinion that the move towards increased radio intelligence will be gradual, rather
than step-wise and that this should considered good news. When J. Mitola launched
the cognitive radio concept [16], many questions arose if and when this disrup-
tive idea could be implemented in practical systems within regulatory constraints.
A gradual and smooth transition is however feasible, as we hope to have shown in
this book. “Good enough” is “close enough to optimal” is thereby the main message
we want to convey when concluding this book. When searching for solutions for
smart(er) and cognitive operation of radios, we follow the same principle. Certainly
in a dynamic environment, such as the wireless scene, the search for ultimate op-
timal operation may take more energy than could be paid off by the actual gains.
Moreover, by the time this optimum is found the conditions may have changed al-
ready. We have proposed a generic control strategy based on a two phased approach.
In a preparation phase, at design time, a representative set of scenarios are analyzed
and corresponding sets of optimal settings are determined and stored. In operation,
at run time, based on observation of the environment and requirements, the param-
eter set corresponding to the closes case are applied. Indeed, a “close enough to
optimal” and thus “good enough” results can then be achieved. As a next step in
the advancement towards true cognitive behavior, systems will then apply learning
techniques to further calibrate and improve these heuristics. A main driver of this
book is the scarcity of available spectrum. First a case considering licensed spec-
trum where Secondary Users use the spare wireless capacity without interfering
the Primary users more efﬁciently has been discussed in Chap. 4. Next, applica-
tion of the approach for coexistence in an unlicensed ISM band was presented in
Chap. 5. Also signiﬁcant energy savings can be achieved through smart(er) opera-
tion. This was illustrated in Chap. 6. As a last and most far-going study the gains
achieved by adding learning and calibration to the control operation is revealed for
a WLAN case in Chap. 7. For future systems, the combined consideration of both
spectrum and energy efﬁciency will be vital to enable a sustainable future wireless
Internet.

8.2 Closing Remarks: The End Is Not There nor in Sight
8.2.1 Keep Moving with the Target
We closed a previous book with the statement “This is not the end, its just the be-
ginning” [1]. Following straight engineering logics, the ideas presented in this book
building on SDRs and DSA are consequently not anymore the beginning of Software
Deﬁned Radio solutions. Yet, this is deﬁnitely not the end, nor is the end in sight. In
this book we advocate smart(er) and cognitive radios as an answer to the bottleneck
that will occur following the ever increasing wireless data trafﬁc within limitations
of available spectrum. Recently, the energy consumption of (wireless) communica-
tion systems and the impact of the emitted electromagnetic radiation have become
a cause for concern. Worldwide, initiatives have been launched and are gaining mo-
mentum to radically reduce the overall energy consumption of communication net-
works and to reduce the carbon footprint of the growing network [130]. If we want
to build tomorrows wireless communications systems, we need to minimize the en-
ergy consumption and restrict the radiation, but not at the penalty of throughput and
intelligent operation. An answer to this challenge showing great potential savings is
the approach to restrict wireless communication to short ranges whenever possible.
Indeed today many connections, speciﬁcally mobile phone calls, connect to a rela-
tively faraway base-station, even if much closer access points (e.g. indoor WLAN)
are present. On the longer term, one may even enable 60 GHz-based local wire-
less access, allowing very directive transmission at data rates that exceed 1 Gbps.
This concept based on distributed access in a heterogeneous network environment
is illustrated in Fig. 8.2.
A major part of the radiation and the wasted energy can be avoided and high
data throughput is enabled. In order to enable this, multi-standard terminals, which
can be realized attractively (both for cost and form factor) when based on recon-
ﬁgurable radio solutions, will be key. Energy efﬁcient operation of these radios is

132

Close
a main design goal, and cognitive features are clearly desired. The usage of mm-
wave communication for short-range access purposes has recently gained interest
in standardization [20]. Deﬁnitely the 60 GHz spectrum enables wider spectrum
still, moreover frequency reuse at very short distances is possible, and thus smaller
cells are promoted. Low cost and low power 60 GHz radios will be a vital technol-
ogy, and are gaining maturity. Directive and adaptive antenna (arrays) both below
10 GHz and for mm wave will be essential to maximize connectivity for minimal
energy and radiation. We believe that smart(er) and cognitive radio operation will
be key to enable ever more complex wireless communication networks. We hope to
have been able to show to our readers that workable solutions can bring signiﬁcant
gain already today. Deﬁnitely this is not the end, nor is the end in sight. As (coaches
of) enthusiastic researchers we are convinced that great innovation is on its way
and that this will enable more wireless capacity for/in less spectrum and energy for
many years to come!
